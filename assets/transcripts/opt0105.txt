Course Overview
Course Overview
Have you heard of the cloud? Of course you have, but what is the cloud? I mean, really. What are the different types of cloud and how can they change your life? Watch my new course at Pluralsight. com to find out. My name is David Davis and my latest course is Cloud Computing Fundamentals. I've been writing, teaching, and speaking about cloud computing since before cloud computing was called the cloud. I've created over 50 Pluralsight. com courses and this is one of the best courses yet. Did you know that cloud computing is being used by just about every person or company on the internet today in some shape or form. Most people use the cloud and never even think about it. In this course you're going to learn how the cloud works, how it can help you, and the different types of cloud computing. You're going to see them in action. Specifically, we'll cover infrastructure as a service and how it compares to virtualization, the difference between private cloud, hybrid cloud, and public cloud. We'll cover how to migrate to the cloud, how infrastructure-as-a- service, networking, security, and storage works. What platform-as-a-service is and how it compares to infrastructure- as-a-service and finally, how software-as-a-service makes your life so much easier. By the end of the course you'll truly understand the different types of cloud computing, you'll see them in action, and you'll feel comfortable with cloud computing. Now you don't need to know anything to get started so just buckle up, grab a beverage, and join me on this quick trip to the clouds while watching my Cloud Computing Fundamentals training at Pluralsight. com.

Introduction to the Course
Introduction to the Course
Hello and welcome to Cloud Computing Fundamentals. You're watching the introduction to the course. My name is David Davis and I'll be your instructor. So what are you going to learn in this module? Well, this module like I said is just the introduction to the course. So in this module you'll learn why cloud computing, why is cloud computing so important and why is everybody talking about it? From there you'll learn what you'll learn in this course. We're going to talk about everything we're going to talk about so you'll get a good overview in this module of everything you're going to learn so that you're prepared and you have some idea of what you're getting into. After that we'll talk about the prerequisites for the course. I'll give you a little hint. There aren't any. This is an introductory course; this is a fundamentals course. So because of that, you don't need to know anything. Now of course if you have some background knowledge in computers, great! That's going to help you out, but if you know nothing about cloud computing and you just want to learn what the heck is the cloud that people keep talking about on TV, right? You're going to learn the answer to that and much, much more in this course. After that, I'll tell you a little bit about myself, my background, and why I feel like I'm qualified to help you learn about cloud computing. We've got a lot to cover. This is going to be a really fun and a really educational course so let's get started.

Why Cloud Computing?
So the title of this course is Cloud Computing Fundamentals. So the first thing we need to answer is why cloud computing? Why do we need to learn about cloud computing? Who really cares, right? Well, let me tell you why. Let me tell you why this is so important to you, whether it's just you and your personal computer or whether it's you as an IT professional working in a large enterprise. First off, cloud computing is everywhere. It's in use around the world, in many different forms and by all different types of people and by all different types of companies. I mean, you can't look at a commercial, let's say, on your favorite TV show without hearing something about the cloud or without hearing about some kind of company that's utilizing the cloud. In fact, you can't even use your own personal cell phone today without in some way, shape or form, utilizing cloud computing. Cloud computing is also so powerful and that's one of the reasons that it's everywhere; I mean it can run just about any application, it can do it just about anywhere, anytime, and at any scale, whether it's just your own personal, let's say Gmail that you're connecting to, or whether it's a massive application like let's say Netflix, right? The cloud can be used for so many different things. It's so powerful and that's why it's in use by really everyone. Cloud computing also makes your life easier and frankly, that's one of the many reasons that people have flocked to cloud computing. It allows you to do more with less. It allows you to be more efficient, to save time and to save money. And again, that goes back to why it's everywhere. It's in use by just about everyone out there in some way, shape, or form; it's in use by just about every company out there. So right now you might be thinking cloud computing is just the best thing since sliced bread, right? I mean it sounds like cloud computing can do no wrong, but we're going to learn about the pros and the cons as well as the many forms and types of cloud computing in this course, so buckle your seatbelt; we've got a lot to cover.

What Youâ€™ll Learn in This Course
Here's what you'll learn in this course. We're going to kick it off with the basics of the cloud. That's the next module in this course, so make sure you watch that one if nothing else. Of course, I hope you watch the whole course so that you learn about infrastructure-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, and software-as-a-service, something I bet that you're using already and you might not even know. We're going to try to make this course really educational and at the same time, really, really fun. I've got lots of examples. We're not going to stick to the slides all the time; we're going to jump out and we're going to show you a wide variety of cloud computing services and also, I'm going to try to keep this course relatively course, around 2 hours or less so that you can learn all about cloud computing in a relatively short period of time. And speaking of time and brevity, this module's almost done, let's move on.

Prerequisites
Now one of the most common questions any time you go to learn anything new is what are the prerequisites, what do I need to know before I get started? Some people might be a little nervous; they don't want to get in over their head and that's okay. In this course I'll tell you like I told you at the start, this is a fundamentals course and part of the fundamentals course is fun, right? Fun-damentals, okay? But the point being is this is an introductory course and we want this to be fun, we want it to be easy, and so the prerequisites for this course, in case you're concerned are none, right? There are no prerequisites. You just need to be interested in cloud computing. Now if you have some knowledge about computers and networks and storage, awesome! That is great. This course is going to be really, really easy for you. If you have no knowledge about that stuff, that's okay. This course is introductory enough that you're going to learn a lot and you're still going to have fun and after this course, I hope that you go and get some more of that knowledge and learn about the basics of computers and networks and storage and Pluralsight. com offers courses on all of those topics. Always look out for the beginner courses. You can filter courses by the difficulty of the course. So find a beginner course around computers, networking, and storage after learning about cloud computing and you're on a great technology education path.

About Your Author
Now some of you may be wondering, why is this guy David Davis qualified to teach me about cloud computing? Cloud computing is relatively new, you might be thinking. How can David Davis know all about this? Well, I'll tell you. That's me there and I've created over 50 video training courses for Pluralsight. com with most of those being around virtualization and cloud computing and I'll tell you cloud computing is not new. In fact, you'll learn in the next module, cloud computing has actually been around for a long time. It's really only recently gotten very popular and gotten into the mainstream, if you will, where just about everyone's using cloud computing. So I've been aware of cloud computing and have used it in some shape or form for many, many years now. In fact, I created my first video training course on cloud computing quite a few years back. I've also served in the enterprise at real businesses as a server admin, a network admin, an IT manager, and even worked on mainframe computers, which were really kind of the original shared computing cloud infrastructure, if you will. In fact, I'm passionate about all things cloud and here's why. I think that cloud computing is the best thing to happen in the world of technology with maybe the only exception being the invention of the internet. I'm constantly amazed at everything you can do in the cloud and I want to share that knowledge and that passion with you and I hope that that comes through in this course. Now if you have questions about the course, Pluralsight has a great course discussion option that you could use right there in the web interface when you're watching the course. I don't believe it's available on mobile, but it does work on the web interface for Pluralsight. com where many people watch these video training courses and from that interface you can post questions inside each module of the course and I'll be monitoring those course discussions and I'll do my best to respond to those in a timely manner. You can also contact me on Twitter where I'm @DavidMDavis and then additionally you can find more information about me at my blog, DavidMDavis. com.

Summary
And with that we've reached the summary for this first module in the course. I told you it was going to be short and I told you that you would learn why cloud computing is so important. I hope that you know that now. It's everywhere, it's powerful, and it can make your life easier. In the next module you'll learn in much more detail exactly why you learned what you'll learn in this course. We covered the main topics of the course, infrastructure-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, and software-as-a-service. From there you learned the prerequisites of this course; there aren't any, right? And then finally you learned a little bit about me, your author. Thanks so much for watching this course. From here you'll jump into the next module which is Cloud Computing, the basics. I hope you enjoy the course and have fun.

Cloud Computing - The Basics
Overview
You may have seen a commercial on TV from the likes of Microsoft where a person has a problem sharing photos and someone says, "take it to the cloud, " and the cloud seems to solve all their problems. You might've seen another commercial from Microsoft where they say they're having trouble accessing their home computer and someone says, "take it to the cloud, " and the cloud seems to fix everything, right? So what the heck is the cloud? Well, in this module that's exactly what you'll learn, the basics of cloud computing. My name is David Davis and I'll be your instructor for this module. In this module we'll kick it off by answering the most basic of questions. What is it? What is cloud computing exactly? From there you'll learn the traits of a cloud. What is a cloud and isn't a cloud? What should you look for? After that I'll talk about the benefits of cloud computing. What's it good for? How does it help you? From there we'll also address what many people leave out, which are the risks of cloud computing. What risk are you taking when you move something to the cloud? From there we'll cover the many forms of cloud computing. There are many different ways to use the cloud. I'll talk about the history of cloud computing, it's not brand new, although you might think that it is, and then from there I'll show you a demo of cloud computing in action. We've got a lot to cover so let's get started.

What Is It?
So here it is, drum roll please. What is cloud computing? Here's the big announcement. Cloud computing is on-demand computing resources delivered to you over the internet. Now think about that for a minute. You need access to some sort of computing. Maybe it's an application you need to run, maybe it's just a server that needs to be started for your company. No matter what it is, the cloud can provide those on-demand resources and they're delivered to you in most cases, I should caution in most cases, over the internet. Now another way to answer the question, what is cloud computing? Cloud computing is a computing service that you traditionally did local or on-premises as it's called, meaning in your own office building let's say or on your own local computer and it's now performed remotely across the internet or across some network and it's performed off-premises meaning it's performed somewhere else, in some other office, in somebody else's data center, on somebody else's computer. So those are the two basic definitions of cloud computing. Basically it's the computing that you need, but it's done by someone else and it's done somewhere else. Now according to virtualization giant and we'll talk more about virtualization, cloud computing is an approach to computing that leverages the efficient cooling of an on-demand, self-managed virtual infrastructure. So what they're saying here is that there's this virtual infrastructure and we'll talk about virtualization so don't worry about that too much, but it's available to you when needed and you can manage it yourself. You can start and stop things yourself. You don't have to call an IT expert. And another point here is that it's a pool of resources. So you're not accessing just a single computer over the internet, although you could be, but in general, cloud computing is the accessing of a large pool of resources to gain access to the applications that you need and you can manage those applications and those resources yourself. So those are three different definitions of cloud computing. Let's move on and let's talk about the traits of a cloud. What are the qualities that you would look for to identify cloud computing?

Traits of a Cloud
So when it comes to the traits of a cloud, what exactly is a cloud? Well, a cloud is elastic meaning it can scale up or down. Think of Elastic Man, like a superhero. His arms and legs can scale up and down as needed; they stretch in and out as needed and a cloud is the same way. You never hear about Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure or Gmail running out of space, right? Now you might run out of space in your own personal Gmail account based on what you pay for, but Google who owns Gmail, they don't ever seem to run out of space or capacity. They seem to be able to infinitely scale up, but they could also scale down if needed. Now if you were to use some cloud computing resources, basically you pay for what you need to use and in most cases those resources are available infinitely for you and if you don't need as many resources next month, they you can scale those resources down. It's not your problem to have to deal with. You don't have to think about what resources are available in the cloud. You're just able to consume the resources that you need when you need them and to get rid of them when you don't; it's that easy. The cloud is also metered, meaning you only pay for what you use. So there's no long-term contracts in most cases and in most cases you just pay by the minute or by the computing resource, whatever it is, you're able to pay in very small increments, just like your electric utility or your water service; you pay for what you use and no more. That means that it's very easy to use the cloud, put it on your credit card; it might not cost you but a few dollars to use the cloud for, let's say, a day. It's a small service and when you're done with it, you just get rid of that service and you no longer pay for it and then a cloud is self-service, meaning there's no or there's reduced need for IT experts. So let's say that I need a brand-new web server and I'm going to run it in the cloud. I don't have to go talk to my IT manager, I don't have to talk to the server admin, he doesn't have to spec out the server, order it from let's say HPE or Dell, get the server in, rack it and stack it and hook it up to the UPS, connect it to the network, install the operating system, install the web server, install the database, and then maintain and upgrade it forever. With the cloud, I don't need any of those people and I don't need to consume their time, which costs the company money. I just simply with a few clicks, provision a web server and I'm able to run my applications that I need to run. I put it on my credit card, I pay a few cents per minute to consume it for example, and I can scale up and add as many more web servers as I need and when I don't need them, I can simply delete them and take them off my account. So those are some of the traits of the cloud that you need to be aware of and that you need to be on the lookout for when identifying what cloud computing is and is not. Now to understanding, you must also be able to answer these questions. First off, where are my applications running? Traditionally you would purchase an application. Let's say you would go to your local computer store and you would buy an application on maybe CDs or in the olden days, floppy disks, right? You would bring that home, you would install the application and you would run it locally on your computer inside your desktop or laptop computer, on your operating system, you have this application, you have a little database, and let's say it's a financial application. You run that application local and store the data local. When the new upgrade comes out, you have to purchase that upgrade from the manufacturer. Again, get the CD disk, install it, and upgrade your own application. That might only happen, let's say once a year if that. You also have to protect yourself from data loss so you have to do backups and keep those backups offsite. With cloud computing, you simply access an already existing, already installed application over in the cloud in someone else's data center and they're responsible for installing the application, upgrading the application, maintaining the application, protecting your data. All you have to do is pay a simple monthly fee. You never seem to run out of disk space to store your data; it's infinite as long as you pay for the capacity that you use. So that's how it works with cloud computing. Your applications aren't running locally, they're running offsite, off-premises in the cloud. Another thing to think about is your data. Where is your data stored? And this is really the same answer as the application, right? If your application is running in the cloud, in most cases your data is also stored with that application and so that's something to keep in mind. What would happen if that cloud provider went out of business or they were unavailable for a few days. Your applications and your data would also be unavailable. So these are some of the risks to consider and again, we'll be talking about those soon, but as you can see, there are also so many benefits to consider. You never had to purchase that application, you never had to install it, you don't have to protect that application's data, you don't have to even upgrade that application. Better yet, you don't even have to purchase an upgrade because you simply pay the monthly fee and the application is magically upgraded and new features are available, in most cases much more frequently than let's say once a year as with a traditional package software design.

Benefits of Cloud Computing
So now let's talk about the benefits of cloud computing and we've talked about these benefits to some degree, but I want to summarize them in one long list so you're aware of all the benefits of cloud computing. So the first one here is fast access to resources or applications that you or your company needs. So let's take the previous example a little bit further. Let's say that you have a small business, perhaps you have 20 employees. They need access to email. You could go and purchase your own email server, you could install let's say Microsoft Exchange and purchase a license for that, configure the mail records, all those things or you could go to someone like Gmail or Office 365 and you could much more easily, much more inexpensively and with much less complexity have your own email system up and running within, for example an hour instead of what might be a couple weeks with the traditional physical server model, much less having to learn how to install, configure, and administer something like Microsoft Exchange. So just an example how cloud computing can provide you and your company fast access to the resources or applications that you need. Another benefit is you only pay for what you use. So with the Microsoft Exchange model you might have to purchase a physical server that scales up to, for example, 200 users when you don't really need that capacity; you just have 20 users who need access to email. So with cloud computing you just pay on a per-user basis; you pay only for the licenses for the users that you need and if let's say a year later you have to cut staff down to just 10, well then you only pay for 10 licenses instead of 20 and compare that to having to pay for a physical server and software licenses that support up to 200 users. Another benefit here is there's no capital expenditures to get started. So again, with the email server you don't have to purchase a physical server. You don't have to purchase a Windows server O/S license. You don't have to purchase Microsoft Exchange. None of that capital expense is needed. Simply pay on a per-user basis each month for the number of users who are using the mail system and then there's the potential to eliminate the need for local IT staff to maintain infrastructure and applications. Now I'm not a fan of firing anyone here or getting rid of any employees and that's not what cloud computing is about. The benefit here is let's say that your company was a little larger than the 20-person company. For example let's say you had 200 employees in a medium-size office and you might need to support those employees, let's say 10 physical servers. Well to manage and maintain 10 physical servers you're going to need one if not two admins, technical experts who are familiar with servers, storage, operating systems, applications like Microsoft Exchange. With cloud computing, all of this can be done in the cloud and no, you don't want to have to get rid of those IT experts, but instead of having them spend their time upgrading the servers, replacing the power supplies, worrying about disaster recovery, requesting a diesel generator to keep the servers up, worrying about the cooling and the data center, all those things that you have to do when you have your own server room or computer room. These IT experts that you're paying handsome salaries for don't have to worry about any of that stuff and instead they can focus on the business, they can help the business to leverage cloud computing and do what they can to use technology for the business benefit to improve competitive advantage and to improve the bottom line or the net income for the business to ensure that technology can help the business be profitable. Cloud computing also has the potential to lower your costs for the company when it comes to computing and applications and I don't say it always lowers those costs, but it has the potential to lower those costs. Additionally, you can deploy what you need yourself with self-service. So configuring for example, Office 365 to provide your company's employees email access requires a little bit of knowledge, but it's far less knowledge than what's needed to spec out a physical server, some storage, UPS battery backup, install an operating system, install Microsoft Exchange and configure it from there. So you don't need as much expertise and you can configure new user accounts with a few clicks of a mouse. Anyone can do that to add let's say a new email user mailbox for your company. So cloud computing is very focused around self-service and making things easy. And then finally, cloud computing allows the IT staff to instead focus on the business and we talked about that a little bit above. Yes, you have the potential to eliminate local staff, but more than likely that local staff is needed for projects that increase the bottom line of the company. Business experts who understand technology and can leverage technology to make the business more efficient and that's really what the IT staff wants to do anyway. It shows that they can provide real value to the business instead of just keeping the lights on, as it's called or keeping the physical servers up and running. That doesn't provide any real value to the business at all. What the business needs is the applications to do their job and do their job quickly and efficiently. The business doesn't need a data center full of servers. So those are the benefits in my opinion of cloud computing, but cloud computing doesn't also come with some risks. So let's talk about those risks now.

Risks of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing offers a ton of benefits, but just like anything that promises a ton of benefits, in many cases there's also at least one, if not a few risks that might be associated with those benefits and that's the case with cloud computing as well. So first off, with cloud computing one of the risks is that you're placing your trust in the cloud provider, meaning if you store all your data in Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure and one of those services goes down, you no longer have access to that data. Now those cloud computing providers invest millions or billions perhaps in ensuring that they do everything they can to protect from their services ever going down and maintain high availability, but not everything is within their control and sometimes cloud providers just like any provider do have some sort of downtime or performance slowdown, so you're placing complete trust in the cloud provider and if that provider goes down, then you're no longer going to have access to your data or applications and that's just one of the risks that you need to take. Now cloud providers like I said, they do things that seem crazy in traditional data centers. I mean redundant connections into the building, massive amounts of power and cooling, hardened data centers, very high levels of security and then they have redundant data centers all around the world and sometimes you also need to take into account how your application is designed because with these cloud providers, you can specify that your data is replicated to multiple sites, but not everyone does it. So if you don't take advantage of the high-availability services from the cloud provider, then of course you're accepting the risk that the cloud provider might go down. You also need to be aware of the service-level agreement, which is the agreement between you and the provider that says that if the cloud provider does go down, what they will provide to you in return. So there could be some financial benefits back to you or refunded service fees if the provider goes down and you cannot access your data or applications. There's the potential for data loss, just like when you store your data anywhere. It could be on your local computer. There's always the potential for data loss, but with the cloud provider, if you put complete trust in them and you store all your data in that cloud provider and then that data is somehow lost, then you just have yourself to blame, right? So you always need to have backups even if you put everything in the cloud, you can back up from one cloud provider to another cloud provider or you can back up what's in the cloud locally down to your own data center or to your own computer. Yes, you can back up your Gmail or your Office 365 documents. You can back up all of that data that's in the cloud, so there's always the potential for data loss with any service, with any storage and that's just a risk that you need to keep in mind any time you store data really anywhere. And then just like the potential for downtime, there's also the potential for slow access to your data. I mean, you're separating yourself from your data and let's say that massive amounts of data or perhaps that data grows massively over time. If one day you decide to download all that data or move it to another cloud provider or move it to your own data center, you have the potential for very slow access to that data and that's just something to keep in mind. After all, your connection to the cloud is only as fast as your network connection to the internet or perhaps you have a private connection to this cloud provider, but in most cases it's the internet. Another risk to be aware of is potential questions related to legality or regulatory, for example financial or government entities. They can't just store their data in the cloud anywhere, for example, out of the country. They have to keep in mind government regulations and the law associated with the data that they're storing and the data that they have to protect. Now if we're talking about your own personal email, this isn't something you have to worry about, but if you have a company and you're storing medical data, health data, employee data, financial data or credit card data or any data that's regulated by the government, you're going to have to take into special consideration which cloud provider you use and where they're storing your data. Then there's the potential for loss of customization. If you run your own, let's say financial application locally, you can customize it all you want, assuming you have the source code or the ability to do so, but when you move to a financial application, let's just say as an example in the cloud, that cloud provider is going to share access to that single application to everyone and it's likely that you're not going to have as much control or as much potential to customize that application as you would an on-premises application. And then there's the potential for unknown costs. If you purchase let's say your own servers and storage and software applications and run everything locally, you know exactly what the costs are going to be. When it comes to cloud computing there may be scenarios where you consume much more than you anticipated that you would consume and you end up with a much larger bill than you anticipated you would receive. So again, that's something to keep in mind. When you spin up, let's say virtual machines in the cloud, you're paying by the minute or by the hour for those virtual machines. So if you forget about them and just leave them on out there all month long, you might get a much larger bill at the end of the month than you thought you would. So those are the risks that you need to be aware of with cloud computing. Everything has risk, right? Just getting in your car and driving down the street has risks associated with it, but there are also many benefits to cloud computing. From here on out, I believe we'll be focusing primarily on all of the benefits, but I'm glad that you took the time to educate yourself on the risk that's also associated with using cloud computing.

Many Forms of Cloud Computing
Now I mentioned earlier that cloud computing comes in many forms. So what does that mean exactly? Well, one of the forms of cloud computing is called SaaS or software-as-a-service. So with SaaS you're accessing applications directly in the cloud. These applications are already running and you're just simply paying to use them. So this is the most likely form of cloud computing that you have already used. Examples could be Gmail, Office 365, SalesForce. com, even Dropbox is a software-as-a-service and we've got a whole module on software-as-a-service later in the course. So again, SaaS is software, it's an application that you're using that's running in the cloud. Another form of cloud computing is infrastructure-as-a-service or IaaS as it's commonly called. So within infrastructure-as-a-service you're accessing a virtual machine. So that virtual machine is an instance of a physical computer virtualized and running in the cloud. So it has an operating system, it has virtual hardware like virtual CPU, memory, virtual storage, virtual networking. On top of that operating system you can do whatever you want. You can install applications, you could install a web server, you could install a database server. So this is typically how an enterprise that's wanting to move computing resources out of their data center and into the cloud would use the public cloud. They would use this infrastructure-as-a-service to replace or to augment their existing infrastructure that's running in their server room or in their data center. Another form of cloud computing is platform-as-a-service or PaaS as it's commonly called. With platform-as-a-service, developers who need access to a platform, a development platform, for example it could be a SQL server that's already running and they simply need access to deploy a database or it could be a web server that's already running and they need access just to put their code on that web server and deploy a new web application. Platform-as-a-service or PaaS services provide those developers exactly what they need to get their application or their database up and running very, very quickly. They don't have to worry about maintaining the underlying web server or the underlying operating system or the computing hardware. They simply deploy their web application and that web server from their perspective, seems to scale infinitely and they only pay in many cases per transaction, some sort of usage, utility-based consumption model. And again, we have an entire module in the course on platform-as-a-service. And then after software-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service, if you look out on the internet you'll find many other forms of cloud computing. In fact, I am confident you'll find just about everything out there in some shape or form as a service. For example, you'll find desktop-as-a-service where you can access virtual desktops in the cloud. You'll find backup-as-a-service where you can utilize backup services to protect your data either on- or off-premises. You'll find storage-as-a-service where you simply store data out there in the cloud. There are many different forms of cloud computing, but SaaS, IaaS and PaaS typically encompass most everything out there, though keep an eye out for these other types of cloud computing or other branding methods, if you will, to utilize this something-as-a-service marketing terminology.

History of Cloud Computing
Now some people think that cloud computing is brand new and I do agree that the excitement level that it's reached is really new and the exposure that it's gotten to just about everyone out there in the world is really brand new, but the idea of cloud computing where you're sharing resources that are somewhere else, isn't really all that new. So let's talk a little bit about the history of cloud computing and the first quote I want to throw at you here is, "the more things change, the more they stay the same, " and this is actually a French proverb that was later said by Kurt Russell, also known as Snake Pliskin in the "Escape from LA" movie series and I love this quote because it gives me a little bit of piece knowing that the more we see change and change and change happening, the more we look at it closely, the more you'll find that it's not a total change. It's really just something that happened in the past that's been redone and revitalized if you will and then reshaped and rebranded and remarketed and announced as something totally brand new. So when it comes to cloud computing, keep that quote in mind. "The more things change, the more they stay the same. " So if cloud computing has been around for a while, what has it been called in the past? Well, it's been called centralized computing. You might've heard of it as grid computing, distributed computing, on-demand computing, hosting, application service providers or ASPs. Those were big back in the 90s. All these things are essentially cloud computing in one form or another. So how far back does this go? Well, if we look at the timeline here of cloud computing, first there was mainframe computing with the big IBM mainframes back in the 1950s and 60s. These were centralized computers, massive computers with dumb terminals, dumb green screen terminals that were attached to them. They could be local, they could be across some form of landline in a remote location, but they're all connected to the same centralized computer and again, that centralized mainframe computer is a shared pool of resources that in many cases is offsite somewhere. And then throughout the 1960s to the 1980s there was great advancement around the internet. First there was something called ARAPNET, which was a project by the Department of Defense to connect colleges and universities and military establishments all together and then there was this protocol called TCP/IP that became the standard for the internet and it made communication far easier. And then in the 80s, CompuServe connected their network of 500, 000 users directly to the internet and that was kind of the biggest jump at that point for the user base of the internet. And then in 1970 the first virtual machine was run, not in the cloud; it was run on mainframe computers, essentially slicing up those mainframe computer resources to do other things, but that was kind of the first form of virtualization and cloud computing needs virtualization. It also needs the internet and shared resource pools. So all these things were important advancements in what later became cloud computing. Another important advancement was in the 1990s when virtual private networks became available through telecom providers. So a virtual private network or a VPN is a secure tunnel or connection through the public internet, essentially virtualizing a network and making it secure so that one computer could talk to another computer without other computers being able to see that traffic and VPNs are heavily used in cloud computing still today. And then in the 1990s there were numerous cloud computing advancements and the term began to gain some traction. It started to be used in speeches by prominent technologists and then in 1999, that's when the first software-as-a-service truly, that became well known and became extremely popular as you'll see in the next slide here, SalesForce. com was launched. SalesForce. com is a CRM or a customer relationship management application. CRMs were traditionally just available as local applications. They were very expensive and complex. SalesForce. com made CRM access easy. Over the internet you could subscribe to their CRM and you could simply pay based on the user count, the number of users that your company used. And that became really the first successful model for this SaaS or software-as-a-service revolution that really took off. From here, Amazon. com was launched in 2006. They launched EC2 which stands for Elastic Compute Cloud and it's an infrastructure-as-a-service and in 2006 it was launched as a beta. And EC2 really became the first successful model for all other infrastructure-as-a-service solutions. After that, Google Docs was launched in 2006 and if you're not familiar with it, Google Docs is kind of like a Microsoft Office in the cloud. So Google Docs provides a word processor, a spreadsheet, and a presentation tool, all up in the cloud and your data is stored in the cloud as well and then in 2008, Microsoft Azure was launched. The Azure IaaS or infrastructure-as-a-service. This is when Microsoft really jumped into cloud computing. In 2013, Google Compute Engine or GCE was launched. This is Google's infrastructure-as-a-service solution and now in 2016 and 2017, AWS EC2 revenue is at $12. 22 billion and SalesForce. com revenue is estimated to be at over $8 billion in 2017. So as you can see, when SalesForce. com was launched all the way back in 1999 until today, cloud computing has been around a long time and it's taken off just tremendously. We're talking over $8 billion in revenue for a single software-as-a-service application and $12 billion for a single infrastructure-as-a-service solution. Obviously end users and companies are adopting cloud computing like crazy. So maybe you want to see cloud computing in action. That's exactly what we'll do in the next lesson.

Demo â€“ Cloud Computing in Action
Alright, now it's demo time. It's time to see cloud computing in action. What we're going to do is we're going to jump over into Microsoft Office 365 so you can see what that looks like and then from there we'll just briefly jump over into Amazon's EC2, infrastructure-as-a- service solution. Check it out. Here we are in Office 365. So Office 365 is a subscription service from Microsoft. So it's a SaaS or a software-as-a-service and it's a great way for businesses especially, but even individuals to access all the Office applications that they traditionally run on their desktop through the cloud. So if I click on this up here on the top right, you can see I can access my email, calendar, contacts, newsfeed, shared files through OneDrive, SharePoint for content management, task lists, Word for word processing, Excel spreadsheet, PowerPoint presentation, and many other types of applications, all available here through Office 365. I didn't have to load anything, I didn't have to install anything, I didn't have any large capital expenditures up front to get started with this. If I'm just a single individual, of course I can use these just myself personally, or on the flip side, these applications work for my entire company organization and we can work together as a company, we can share files with OneDrive. We can all edit our documents with Word to track our changes and share those documents via email, through our own internal company domain. So if I go into my email here, you can see it works just like my local email, I have full access to my folders, contacts, everything like that. I'll click here to create a new message and send that message. Office 365 is that easy and it works all for a single monthly fee. Compare that to the traditional company model of having to deploy new servers, to share files, to provide user authentication for the whole company, to configure email and calendaring services, and more licenses for Office applications that all have to be installed locally and upgraded. Here's another form of cloud computing. This is Amazon's EC2. If we go up to the Services dashboard here, you can see here's EC2. They offer not just infrastructure-as-a- service, but also platform-as-a-service with Elastic Beanstalk, storage-as-a-service with S3, database-as-a-service, desktop-as-a- service, Virtual Private Cloud, even things like Internet Of Things and Artificial Intelligence, all available through the Amazon Web Services. Just to give you a demonstration of infrastructure-as-a-service, let's go in here to EC2. You can see I'm connected by default to the Northern Virginia Amazon data center and all I need to do to launch a new virtual machine is click here to launch an instance. I can select one of the free-tier virtual machines. I'll select this one. You can see I'm on the free tier model here, which I prefer since I'm just doing this for demonstration purposes and all I have to do here is click Review and Launch. I get one last chance to review that I'm launching a virtual machine with 1 VCPU, 1 GiB of memory and remote access available through SSH over the internet. I'll click Launch here to launch the new virtual machine. I'll go ahead and create a new key pair. This is for security purposes only. I'll give it a name. I'll download the key pair. I'll say launch the instance. It says the following instance has been initiated or launched and then using this key pair I can connect to the instance over SSH or a secure terminal. I'm going to click on the instance name. I'll select the instance, click connect, and we'll use a standalone SSH client. I'll use this connection string here and I'll tell you I've already tested this by configuring these steps up here. So if I launch my terminal emulator and execute this connection string, there we go. I just connected to my virtual server or instance as Amazon EC2 calls it, that's running up in the cloud. From here I can perform commands like ps and see what processes are running on this virtual server that's running up in the cloud and then from here I can execute my applications. That's how easy it is to get up and running with an infrastructure-as- a-service or a software-as-a-service cloud computing solution. Now let's wrap up the module.

Summary
So what've we learned in this module? We kicked it off by talking about what is cloud computing? In that lesson you got some good definitions of exactly what cloud computing is. After that we talked about the traits of a cloud. Clouds are elastic. They can scale up or down easily. Clouds are metered. You only pay for what you use. And clouds offer self-service capabilities. So there's reduced need for IT experts to do things like provision a new user or add a new server. From there we discussed the benefits of cloud computing. There's no upfront capital to get started. You have the potential to lower your costs. You can be more efficient and focus on the business. From there we discussed the risks of cloud computing. Yes, there are some risks associated with cloud computing. Just like with any service, you're purchasing and you're putting your trust in that cloud provider to protect your data, to ensure that they have high availability and there could be some potential for unknown costs. Those are things to look out for. We also learned about the various forms of cloud computing. Software-as-a-service, infrastructure-as-a-service, and platform-as-a-service. Really everything as a service is available out there in the cloud. After that we talked about the history of cloud computing. How cloud computing really started off with mainframe computers, it required advancements in the internet, virtualization, and virtual private networking and then software-as-a-service was launched with SalesForce. com in 1999, Amazon's EC2 infrastructure-as-a-service was launched in 2006, and today cloud computing is just going bananas, right? From there you saw a live demo of cloud computing in action. Office 365 and Amazon EC2, software-as-a-service and infrastructure- as-a-service at its best. Thanks for watching this module on Cloud Computing: The Basics. I hope you enjoyed it. In the next module we'll jump deeper into infrastructure-as-a-service. Thanks for watching.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Overview
We learned earlier how whether you're a small business or a large business, infrastructure-as-a-service or IaaS can help you to get the computing resources you need on-demand. Those resources can scale up, they can scale down. You'll only pay for what you'll use, how they'll make your life easier and how they'll make your business more agile and more competitive. In this module, we'll go more in depth into infrastructure-as-a-service. Here's what you'll learn. We'll kick it off with what is virtualization? Virtualization is the foundation for infrastructure-as-a-service. From there I'll show you what a virtual machine is. I'll show you what a container is. They're similar, but different. We'll cover the difference between private cloud, hybrid cloud, and public cloud. And then we'll compare the difference between virtualization and private cloud. We'll cover IaaS pricing models, service level agreements, and how to migrate to the cloud. How are you going to get from point A to point B. We've got a lot to cover so let's get started.

What Is Virtualization?
Now you might've heard of virtualization a few times so far in the course and you still are probably wondering, what the heck is virtualization? Virtualization is the logical division of physical computing resources. I hope that clears it up. You got it? Maybe not. Let's talk a little bit more about it, okay? Virtualization makes a physical server into a virtual host machine so that virtual host can then run guest virtual machines. I know it might be getting a little more confusing before it becomes clear. So let's talk more about virtualization. Virtualization started in the 1960s as a way to slice up mainframe resources. There are many resources that can be virtualized. You can virtualize the server or the compute as they call it. You can even virtualize over in your storage or on the network with VPNs. There are many forms of virtualization including server and desktop virtualization and virtualization in my mind really became popular with VMware's ESX Server launched in 2001. With ESX Server, enterprise datacenters were able to virtualize their physical hosts and significantly reduce the number of physical servers in the datacenter. From there, VMware's popularity just skyrocketed and today VMware is in use in the majority of all datacenters around the world. So you still might be wondering, what is virtualization? Well, let me pop over into what they call VMware Fusion on my local computer here and just give you a quick example of what virtualization looks like. So here we go. This is one example of virtualization. This is an application called VMware Fusion. With VMware Fusion on this Macintosh computer I can run all these different virtual machines. These are other computers that I can run. I can run Mac OS X. I can run Windows. I can run Linux-based operating systems. All these can be easily run on this one Macintosh computer using virtualization and it's one thing to do it on your desktop like I'm doing it here, but it's another thing to leverage it in the public cloud and that's how public cloud providers work. Not using VMware Fusion, but using a virtualization hypervisor, which is the piece of software that makes virtualization possible. They use a hypervisor in their datacenters across all of their hundreds of thousands of physical servers to run many virtual machines for many different customers in their public cloud datacenter. So what exactly are these virtual computers that we run called virtual machines? Let's talk more about those.

What Is a Virtual Machine?
Virtualization allows you to run these virtual machines. So the hypervisor is the core piece of a virtualization solution. On that hypervisor you're able to run a virtual machine. A virtual machine is a software-based instance of a physical server where a guest operating system has access to emulated virtual hardware. So what exactly does that mean? Well, a virtual machine like I said, runs on top of a hypervisor that's loaded on a physical server. Those virtual guest machines or virtual guests as they're known, run on top of that physical server with the hypervisor and that becomes the virtual host. It provides all of the physical resources to the virtual machines to actually run the operating systems and applications. The operating systems and applications loaded on the guest virtual machines don't know the difference. They don't know that they're running on virtual hardware and that there's other virtual machines. They think they have full access to the physical hardware, to the physical server. So they're provided virtual resources from the hypervisor. Let's jump back into VMware Fusion and I'll show you what this looks like. So here in this virtualization solution, which there are many, this one just happens to be called VMware Fusion, it has a hypervisor. It allows me to run multiple virtual machines. Each of these virtual machines has its own virtualized hardware. So if we go in here to processors and memory, you can see two processors and 3GB of memory are assigned to this virtual machine and my Macintosh computer, my host has much more memory available. It has 29GB or 29, 000MB available to run more virtual machines. So we have plenty of resources and then if we look at the hard disk here, it has a virtual hard disk that has 100GB. That's another virtual resource shared from the host, and then there are virtual network adaptors and you can configure multiple types of virtual networks, we'll talk about virtual networks later, and then when you want to run one of these virtual machines, you just power it on. And there we go. We're running Windows 10 on a Macintosh computer, all thanks to virtualization, all thanks to the hypervisor. If I log in, there we go. We're inside of Windows 10. Thank you, virtualization! But virtualization isn't cloud computing unless that is you're running this virtual desktop over in the cloud. Since I'm running it locally, we're just using virtualization at this point. We aren't actually using cloud computing to do this, but virtualization is what makes cloud computing possible. For a bit of a diagram, let's say this is a physical server on the left or even better, it could be five physical servers here on the left and that physical server is running multiple virtual machines. Each of these represent a virtual machine. I can spit them up, I can spit them down, I can create new ones with a few clicks of a mouse, and all these virtual machines run on top or inside of that single physical host. That way I'm able to do far more than I ever could before with a single physical server. It gives me tremendous flexibility, tremendous efficiency, and like I said, it's the foundation and it's a requirement for cloud computing.

What Is a Container?
Moving on from virtual machines, let's talk about something called a container. So this isn't a Tupperware container, this is a software container. A software container is an operating system-level virtualization where the operating system kernel provides isolated user spaces to run specific applications. Again, you get all that? Easy, right? Well, to help you make a little bit more of it, because that's kind of the dictionary-level definition there, let's talk about what containers are. Now containers have been around for a long time. In fact, containers have been in use just about ever since Unix or Linux have been in use and with containers, the operating system is sliced up into isolated secure areas to run specific applications. So with containers there's still just one operating system. There are not multiple operating systems like with virtualization. Containers can actually be run inside a virtual machine on a virtualization hypervisor so you can use containers with virtualization. Containers have much less overhead than virtualization and virtual machines and they have much faster startup times than virtual machines because essentially you're just running a new application, just in a secure area of the operating system. Now they've been popularized with excitement around Docker, Docker containers. Everybody's talking about it along with the cloud and cloud computing utilizes containers and that's why we're talking about containers at this point. So cloud uses both virtualization and containers. So let me show you what it's like to run a container. I'm going to go to Kitematic here, which is a free Docker tool and I'm going to create a new container called hello-world. nginx or nginx as it's commonly called. I'm going to download the image, the Docker image here, and I don't even have to use a CLI or command line to run this container. Notice it says here on the right, "Viola! Your nginx container is running. " So what I just did is I downloaded a container, a piece of software that has a web server inside and even a sample web page. So here's the web preview from the web server. If I click on that, you can see if I go to this URL here, this is what comes up. So instead of having to install a web server and create a web page, that's already been done. This web server is up and running. I didn't have to configure it, I didn't have to install it, it just works, and that's the idea with containers. I didn't have to install this in my existing operating system. It runs in a secure area of my desktop. It's already installed and it's already configured. That's the ease of containers. That's how efficient containers make the life of an administrator and containers are a huge part of cloud computing. So at this point you saw virtualization in action, fully self- contained computers inside a virtual machine. You saw containers in action. These are fully self-contained applications inside a container. Both of them are completely portable, they can be run on any computer local or in the cloud, and these are just some of the things that make cloud computing possible. Now let's go back to our slides and learn about the differences between private, hybrid, and public clouds.

Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud, and Public Cloud
So we learned about how clouds are elastic, they're metered, and they're self-serviced. They make your life easier, but when you go to look at cloud computing, there are different types of infrastructure- as-a-service cloud offerings. So in this graphic, on the left you see private clouds. Private clouds are run on-premises, meaning they're run in your own building, at your own datacenter. Those types of clouds are for your company to leverage. They're run on your own infrastructure. You're not paying someone else and you're not accessing your data across the internet. On the right-hand side of the diagram here you have public clouds. When we talk about infrastructure-as-a-service we're typically talking about public clouds. That's kind of the natural assumption. Services like Amazon Web Services EC2 and Azure Virtual Machines. And then in between we have they call a hybrid cloud and kind of the weird thing about this is it looks like there's an actual cloud in the diagram. It looks like there are applications running there, but I want to tell you there is not. There is no real hybrid cloud. It's not a real place that you can run your applications or a real place you can go to this hybrid cloud? What the hybrid cloud means is that you've connected your private cloud to your public cloud to create this hybrid cloud. So the definition of hybrid cloud is that these two different clouds are working together. The private cloud and the public cloud are working together. So let's say that in your private cloud you're running a web server, you have a retail company, the Christmas holidays are coming up, and you need a lot more capacity. Well, if you have a hybrid cloud, you're connected to a public cloud already and you can simply burst up or you can scale up the infrastructure in the public cloud to augment your infrastructure running in the private cloud. So the two are working together or you could separate applications. For example, you could run a database in the private cloud and web servers in the public cloud and they're talking to one another, they're communicating across this hybrid cloud. So these are just some terms that you need to be aware of. Companies throw out all the time private, public, hybrid and even a new one called enterprise cloud. Enterprise cloud and hybrid cloud to me are really synonymous, they're really the same thing and to kind of summarize this up, when it comes to IaaS or infrastructure-as-a-service, we're typically talking about public cloud infrastructure-as-a-service offerings; however, you do need to keep in mind that you have the option of creating your own infrastructure-as-a-service private cloud in your own datacenter as well.

Virtualization vs. Private Cloud
So I said that virtualization was required for cloud computing and required for infrastructure-as-a-service and I also said that you could have your own private cloud and your own datacenter, but what's the difference between just having virtualization and having private cloud? A lot of people get confused about this so if you're confused, don't worry, you're in good company. So with virtualization it is required for cloud computing, as I said, and it provides scalability and elastic computing, meaning without virtualization you're going to have a lot of trouble provisioning new physical servers. It takes a long time to get a new physical server in the mail and bring it into the datacenter. With virtualization and virtual machines you can easily clone a new virtual machine and have a new server up and running in seconds. So that's why it's an important part of any sort of cloud. Virtualization also provides that pooling and sharing capability of resources. It provides load balancing for the compute so that if one host runs out of resources, a virtual machine can be moved or started on a new host. It provides high availability at the infrastructure level, portability of the virtual machine. So they can be moved around from host to host or even from the private infrastructure into the public cloud across that hybrid cloud we just talked about. Virtualization also provides the ability to just clone an existing application or virtual machine, essentially duplicating that entire virtual guest operating system, applications, and data into a new instance. This is all essential for a cloud infrastructure. Private cloud on the other hand, on top of virtualization provides the abstraction of the underlying infrastructure layer. Meaning if you're using private cloud, you don't know anything about the virtualization underneath. You don't know what hosts are out there, where the virtual machines are stored exactly, how the high availability or the virtual networking is configured. You don't need to know any of that. Private cloud just makes it easy through a simple portal to deploy a new virtual machine and a few clicks. It also provides secure multi-tendency and what that means is that with my private cloud, I can support not just my company, but other companies and do it in a secure way or maybe different divisions of my company and this is what the public cloud provides. For example, Amazon's EC2 allows me to run my virtual machines securely and without being able to look into other people's virtual machines that are all running on the same physical host. That's called secure multi-tendency. There are multiple customers, multiple tenets. And then a self-service portal. So like I said, I can deploy a new virtual machine very easily in a few clicks of a mouse without having to worry about the underlying physical infrastructure that's running that virtual machine. I get a catalog of applications, essentially a catalog of virtual machines that I want to deploy. I get chargeback or showback, meaning I can report on my usage and I can bill actually internally to the company or let's say I'm running a public cloud like Amazon. I can bill my customers for the usage of the private or public cloud. And then finally the potential to burst to a hybrid cloud. Here we're talking about private cloud. So I have the potential to burst from my private cloud up into the public cloud and scale up my infrastructure, in many cases without the end user who's using this private cloud, ever even knowing where their virtual machines are running, either in the private or the public cloud. So there are a lot of differences between virtualization and private cloud. Virtualization is not the same as private cloud. Private cloud requires virtualization, public cloud requires virtualization, but just because you have virtualization doesn't mean that you have cloud.

IaaS Pricing Models
Now at this point you might be thinking, wow, infrastructure-as-a- service and cloud computing, they sound really awesome, so many benefits, but I probably can't afford that, this sounds really expensive. Well, the great thing about infrastructure-as-a-service pricing is ideally it is based on utility, consumption, or subscription-based pricing. What that means is you pay for only what you use and as you saw in the example I did a minute ago, there was actually even a free tier where I could access this IaaS virtual machine totally for free as long as I didn't go over a certain number of hours and as long as I didn't select a virtual machine that wasn't in the free tier. So you only pay for what you use. It could be just a few dollars to run a virtual machine, even in one of the production, higher-level tiers. Now just as I say, don't worry, cloud computing pricing is super easy and you only pay for what you use and it could even be free, I also want to make sure that I'm conservative on this and I point out that infrastructure-as-a-service pricing can get complex. So they have what they call on-demand pricing. So with on-demand pricing you pay for the compute capacity by the hour with no long-term commitments or upfront payments and on-demand is kind of the classic utility-based, consumption-based pricing model, which is what you usually think of when you think of infrastructure- as-a-service cloud pricing, but there's also what they call spot instances. So spot instances are where you can bid on spare computing capacity for up to 90% off of the on-demand price. So if they have extra capacity they're not using, you can bid on it and you can get it cheap. The down side to this is that essentially those spot instances, that computing capacity could go away at any point so you don't want to run a critical application on that that isn't at least storing data elsewhere. And then are reserved instances. So reserved instances cost less than on-demand pricing, but you also have to commit to a 1 to 3-year term. So you have this term that you are committed to paying for and this is what you would want to do if you're going to be running some production applications in the cloud for the long-term. And then there are dedicated hosts and this might be for your most critical production applications that you're going to be running in cloud for the long term. And I'll tell you, this is really just how Amazon Web Services does their EC3 pricing or infrastructure-as-a-service. Of course, Amazon EC2 is the leader in infrastructure-as-a-service cloud computing, but Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine, all these others are rapidly catching up or trying to catch up maybe I should say, to Amazon EC2. So if you're going to run an application in the cloud, don't you want to know that it's going to be up? Don't you want some agreement or guarantee with the provider? Let's talk about that next.

Service Level Agreements (SLA)
Any time you're going to entrust someone else with your data, with your applications, you need to have some sort of service-level agreement or SLA with the cloud provider; it's very important. So what is an SLA? Well a service-level agreement or SLA defines what level of performance and availability the infrastructure-as-a-service provider will provide you. In fact, service-level agreements aren't just for infrastructure-as-a-service. They're for any cloud computing provider whether it's a software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, or infrastructure. So what happens if the cloud provider can't provide a level of performance and availability that they guarantee in the SLA? Well the SLA will also tell you what they'll do is they're unable to provide that. So will they give you money back? Will they give you service credits? What will they do? And will the level of damages that they provide be adequate to you? Let's say that you move all of your company's data to the cloud and then the following week that data is simply gone. What level of compensation will your cloud provider give to you in real money and will that amount of money, that compensation offset the damages that are going to be done to your company for the loss of that data, the downtime, the impact to the brand, your company's brand? Will your customers continue to use your company for whatever product or service that you provide? You should always be aware of the service-level agreement that's being offered by your cloud provider. For example, Amazon's service-level agreement can be found here. In fact, let's take a second and just go check it out. So here's Amazon's SLA for their EC2 service. As you can see, they guarantee a monthly uptime percentage of at least 99. 95% and if you scroll on down here you can see that if they don't meet those levels of service, they provide you service credit percentages, and if you scroll on down they talk about how you don't automatically receive these service-level credits. You have to open a case and put the words SLA Credit Request in the subject line as well as all the details about the outage to request your service-level credit. So every provider's going to have a different SLA and you want to make sure if you're moving your company's critical data or even your most personal critical data to the cloud that your comfortable with the service-level agreement from that provider.

Migrating to the Cloud
So you might be wondering, okay great. I like the cloud. I like infrastructure-as-a-service, software-as-a-service. How do I get to the cloud? For example, let's say that I have a small business right now. I have a few servers, I have a lot of data. How do I get that to the cloud? Well, some companies will have greenfield deployments. For example, what that means is you just start off fresh, right? So if you can do that, awesome! If you're going to develop a new application, do it in the cloud, start fresh and do it there. Alternatively, like the small business we're talking about here, you're going to have to do some sort of migration and that's going to be a lot more common than these greenfield deployments as they call them. Now before you make the migration to the cloud, you need to first think about the costs that are associated with using the cloud. Amazon EC2 and other cloud providers have calculators to help you estimate the cost of moving to the cloud and consuming the cloud. So I highly encourage that you use one of those calculators to help you make that estimation before you wholeheartedly jump into the cloud. You want to find out what it's going to cost you. What is it that you require from the cloud in terms of security, availability and performance and what's that going to cost you? You want to think about migration versus rebuilding. Do you want to try to migrate your existing servers to the cloud or let's say start with fresh operating systems and applications and then simply move your data or rebuild your applications in the cloud. You want to think about enterprise-grade functionality. I mean you might be used to full data protection and firewalls and anti-virus software and disaster recovery and replication, high availability, all these things already being in place in your datacenter, things you've paid for and implemented throughout the years, but in the cloud, you can't assume that any of that is just simply automatic. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. You need to make sure that whatever cloud provider you select has the enterprise-grade functionality that your company needs. Don't make any assumptions. And then finally what about tools? What tools out there can help you to make this migration? There are a lot of tools that can do conversions of virtual machines, tools that can replicate data real-time to the cloud and then flip a switch and essentially your traffic is redirected to the cloud. There are all sorts of tools to help you make that migration easier to reduce or eliminate the downtime associated with the migration. So make sure you check out the tools that are available, not just from your cloud provider, but also from numerous third parties out there that are now making cloud migrations far easier than they ever were in the past.

Summary
And here we go! We've reached the summary for this module on infrastructure-as-a-service. You learned first off, what is virtualization? Virtualization is in use in so many enterprise datacenters today, even on desktops like mine, maybe yours. Virtualization is what makes infrastructure-as-a-service possible. You saw a virtual machine in action. Then you learned about containers, how a container is an isolated instance of an application and how you can easily download and run containers both on your own desktop as well as in the cloud. Virtualization, virtual machines and containers, they make the cloud possible. From there we discussed the differences between private cloud, hybrid cloud, and public cloud. We covered virtualization versus private cloud, infrastructure-as-a-service pricing models, and service-level agreements before wrapping it up with how to migrate to the cloud, things you need to keep in mind, what to look out for before you make that jump to the cloud. Thanks for watching this module on infrastructure-as-a-service, public clouds. Stay tuned for the next module in this course on infrastructure-as-a-service networking.

Infrastructure as a Service Networking
Overview
Thus far we've talked about virtual machines and containers and how those run in an infrastructure-as-a-service, but whether you're an end user or an administrator, how do you connect to those applications and those servers that are running in an infrastructure-as-a-service or an IaaS cloud? Well, you have to do it over the network somehow, right? Some kind of network and that's exactly what we'll be talking about in this module covering infrastructure-as-a-service networking. We'll kick it off by covering the IaaS networking options. What options are available to you to connect to your infrastructure that's running in the public cloud? From there we'll discuss VPC or virtual private cloud networking and then I'll show you how to connect to the cloud with a virtual private network or a VPN. We've got a lot to cover so let's get started.

IaaS Networking Options
So how do servers in the infrastructure-as-a-service cloud connect to the network and how do you as an end user or administrator, connect to those servers from your home or your office, wherever you might be? Well, when it comes to infrastructure-as-a-service networking options you have two. So basically one is public networking. Essentially just like the web servers you're connecting to with software-as-a-service, with public networking you're infrastructure- as-a-service virtual machines or containers, they have public IP network addresses. So in other words, they're on the internet. These virtual machines running in the infrastructure-as-a-service cloud, they're just on the internet using public IP addresses. So you connect to them via web browser, via SSH which is a secure shell, whatever management or usability options those virtual machines have configured, you just connect to them using a public IP address. Or private networking where you use virtual private networks or VPNs, which are software-based virtual tunnels through the internet to connect to these virtual machines running in the public cloud, or in some cases large enterprises will have dedicated connections. Meaning connections they've purchased through, let's say a telecom carrier that are private and allow them to connect directly to their virtual machines running in an infrastructure-as-a-service public cloud. Either way, with private networking, traffic going to these virtual machines in the public cloud is either encrypted and secured going across the public internet, or it's kept completely off of the public internet. If we take this a step further, let's say that you're an end user or administrator there on the left. You're at your office and you're provisioning three new virtual machines that are going to run in the infrastructure-as-a-service public cloud. You've got the global internet that you're connected to. Just about all of us are connected to the internet, right, from our office especially. So we're connected to the internet, no problem. The internet of course is also connected to the infrastructure-as-a- service public cloud provider. You can see those individual connections, each one connecting to the internet through the cloud provider and then of course you can easily connect to those virtual machines, whether they have web browsers or command line interfaces enabled, you can connect to them from your workstation. This is the public IP addressing option for infrastructure-as-a- service virtual machines. Another option is to use private IP networking, specifically a VPN tunnel. This is a software-based tunnel through the internet. So just like before, you're the end user or administrator on the left, you have the global internet, you're connected to the internet, but you also configure a software layer on top that goes through the internet directly to the public cloud provider where you're running your virtual machines and then those virtual machines connect to the tunnel endpoint, which is just software for the VPN tunnel. This allows you to securely communicate to your virtual machines running in the infrastructure-as-a-service public cloud through the internet in a way that's completely encrypted and secure.

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Networking
So let's talk about something that Amazon Web Services specifically offers, but so do other cloud providers and they probably call it something slightly different, but the concept is the same. They all offer this service. It's called VPC or virtual private cloud and having VPC alone doesn't mean that you have a virtual private cloud, but specifically it's VPC networking that we're talking about here. So what is VPC networking? Well, Amazon's VPC like I said, is not a private cloud, but it's a private network that can be connected to your network. With VPC in place you have control over private IP addressing in the public cloud. You have control over routing, network access lists, basically security, who can get in and who can't, and VPN connectivity back to your on-premises infrastructure. So with VPC you essentially have a private network in the public cloud that your virtual machines are running in. They may or may not have access to the public internet; perhaps they just have access back to your private network in your own datacenter. So in our next lesson we'll show you VPC in action.

Connecting to the Cloud with a Virtual Private Network (VPN)
So with that, it's everyone's favorite time, it's demo time. Let me show you how to connect to the cloud with a virtual private network. We'll also discuss Amazon's VPC and I'll show you the basics of how it works. Here in Amazon Web Services we're going to go up to the Services dashboard and down here to networking and click on VPC. The first time you go in here, I'd recommend you run what they call the VPC Wizard, so that's exactly what we're going to do. The VPC Wizard gives us the option of creating a VPC with a single public subnet, a VPC with public and private subnets, and a VPC with public and private subnets and hardware VPN or a VPC with private subnet only and hardware VPN access. After all, this is a fundamentals course so let's just keep this simple. We'll create a single VPC with a single public subnet. We'll click Select and then here you can see how within the VPC you can configure private IP addressing. This private IP addressing is going to be translated to public IP addresses. So again, that goes back to the private versus the public. In this case we're using private and it can be translated and accessed via the internet using public IP addresses that we'll get to map to the private. From here we'll click Create VPC. And a lot of networking has just been done for us with a single wizard. Let's say OK and what we're looking at here are some different networks that have been created for us. Now of course this isn't an Amazon VPC video training course. Nigel Poulton at Pluralsight. com has an awesome VPC video training course so I'm not going to go into that. The point here is that you can create private networks within the public cloud and they can be secure. You can configure the security groups and network access lists over here and then you can go in and you can configure virtual private networks or VPN connections from your own on-premises infrastructure, from your own datacenter, even from your own local computer up to the public cloud using a virtual private network. So to do that here in Amazon you configure first virtual private gateways. You give those virtual private gateways a name, I'll say create, and then it's here that you would attach this to a VPC and then go into the customer gateway over here under VPN connections and then create customer gateways. These are basically your connection to the public internet. These are essentially where you connect from Amazon to your VPN endpoint. So that's a quick demo of infrastructure-as-a-service networking. So that's the end of the demo on infrastructure-as-a-service cloud networking and the important thing to know here is not that you know everything about cloud networking by the end of this module, but that there are easy wizards to help you walk through the process and that you can have virtual machines in the cloud, both on the public network as well as very securely on a private network with a VPN tunnel that routes all the way back to your or to your company. That way you can use the cloud to run secure enterprise applications, even enterprise applications that never even talk to the public internet.

Summary
And with that we've reached the summary for this module. We learned about infrastructure-as-a-service networking options, essentially do you use private or do you use public IP addressing for your virtual machines and containers running in the public cloud. We talked about virtual private cloud or VPC networking available from Amazon and then in the demo I showed you how to connect to the cloud with a virtual private network or a VPN as well as Amazon's VPC. Thanks for watching this module on infrastructure-as-a-service networking. Stay tuned for our next module in the series on using storage in the cloud.

Storage in the Cloud
Overview
Thus far we've talked about running your software in the cloud or software-as-a-service, your infrastructure in the cloud or infrastructure-as-a-service, but what about your storage? Where do you store your data in the cloud? How do you do that? What are the multiple options for doing that? That's exactly what we'll be covering in this module. We'll kick it off with understanding infrastructure-as-a-service storage options. From there we'll cover cloud file storage, object storage, and then wrap it up with data protection in the cloud. We've got a lot to cover, so let's get started.

Understanding Infrastructure as a Service Storage
So let's say that you're running infrastructure-as-a-service. You've got virtual machines or containers, they're running in the cloud somewhere, maybe in Amazon Web Services, maybe in Azure, maybe in Google Compute Engine. No matter what infrastructure-as-a-service option you're using, you have to think about where are your files stored? Where is your data stored? That's what we'll talk about in this first lesson. So when it comes to understanding infrastructure-as-a-service storage options, you basically have two to consider. The first one is you store your data or your files inside the virtual machine. They could be raw files sitting on the disk, they could be data stored inside of a database that's running on the virtual machine. No matter what the case, your data is in the virtual machine instance. So each virtual machine has its own storage just like you saw when I demonstrated my local VMware Fusion with a local virtual machine. That local virtual machine had a big virtual disk that's actually stored on my computer. In the case of infrastructure-as-a-service cloud computing, each virtual machine in the cloud has its own virtual storage and it's stored with the virtual machine that's running in the cloud. So that's one option. Store your data in the virtual machine. Another option is to store your data outside of the virtual machine. In that case each virtual machine can access external storage of some kind and it could be block storage in the cloud or object storage in the cloud. For example, Amazon has something called EBS or Elastic Block Storage. That's a shared storage solution that's running in Amazon and that's where you can put your data and then share it between all of the different virtual machines that are running in the cloud. So that's block storage. Another option is object storage and we have a whole less on that here in just a second, but the main benefit of object storage is that it's perfect for unstructured data. That means data that's not in the traditional file system structure. So for example on a website you have let's say, 1000 graphics that need to be published and accessible via the website, these graphics make up the website. Those would be stored in object storage in no particular order. We'll talk more about object storage in just a minute, but first, let's move on and let's talk about cloud file storage.

Cloud File Storage
When it comes to storing your files in the cloud, there's a handful of well-known cloud file storage solutions such as Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and Google Drive. Now I use all three of these. In fact, I'm using all three of them really right now. Dropbox is a long-time favorite, but Microsoft OneDrive and Google Drive are also very good options. So this is Dropbox. These files are stored in the cloud. Dropbox has its own local client and these files and folders have been synchronized from that local client on my local file system up into the Dropbox cloud. Here on my local Mac Finder window you can see the same folder and file structure. If I go into one of these folders, you can see here the little checkbox that shows whether or not this has been synchronized to the cloud. If I right click on this, I can share these files or these folders, manage access, copy a Dropbox link, or view the same file over on Dropbox. com. Every time I create or modify a file locally on my local Dropbox folder, it's synchronized and protected up in the cloud plus Dropbox makes sharing files with anyone in the world super easy just by providing them the web-based link to the file that they can access via their web browser, just like I did here. I can also access my files from my phone or my iPad or any of my other computers anywhere in the world. If anything happens to one of my computers, my files are synchronized with the other computers as well as with the cloud. So I'm protected, my data is protected. Dropbox also has consumption-based pricing. So if I go up here to my profile and into my settings, you can see that I have a 1 TB per year personal plan and I'm paying $99 per year. I happen to have the maximum plan that Dropbox allows, but there are much smaller plans including a free Dropbox plan. And the great thing about Dropbox is that everything is self-service. So I don't need a file server administrator to administer the files from my company. I can have my own personal Dropbox and then I can have my work Dropbox as well. Both can be easily administered from the web all with a self-service interface. Now other solutions with Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive also work very similarly. A local file client that's synchronizes the files up to the cloud as well as a web-based interface and then applications on your iPad, your iPhone, your Android device, to allow you to access your files and documents and videos and pictures anywhere you are and have them remain protected at all times within the public cloud.

Object Storage
Another type of cloud file storage is object storage and we talked about this for just a minute. Object storage is storage for unstructured data. Examples of unstructured data are pictures or graphic files, video files, files that you might offer for download from a website. None of this type of data really needs to be structured in a specific hierarchy and that's why object storage is usually used for pictures, videos, and things like archival data. Now the most popular object storage service in the world is Amazon's S3 or Simple Storage Service. Now their competitor is Microsoft Azure Blog Storage. Both of these are great, like I said, for pictures, videos, and archival data, but they aren't just for low-priority, non-critical data. In fact, recently Amazon's S3 had a massive outage and so many web applications went down because their files are based on and stored in Amazon's S3 and when S3 was down, so were those web applications. Of course, those web applications need to be designed a little bit better to distribute their files across multiple object storage solutions out on the internet. And by the way, you could also run object storage on-premises. You can use things like CEPH, which is spelled C-E-P-H, you can use Swift, with both of those being open source object storage solutions and you can use many more. If we pop over to Amazon, here in the AWS dashboard you can see underneath storage, S3. If we go into S3, what you can do here is you can create what they call a bucket. A bucket is a name that represents a storage container. In that storage bucket you'll store your objects, things like graphics and videos and then you're able to access those objects over the internet. Again, this scales virtually infinitely up and down. It's completely self-service and you only pay for what you consume. You only pay for the files that you actually store in the Amazon S3 object storage.

Data Protection in the Cloud
So what about data protection in the cloud? Well we talked about file storage in the cloud and yes, those file storage options do give you some level of data protection. I mean if you drop your files into your local Dropbox folder and they're synchronized up to the cloud, yes, you have a secondary copy of those files and to some degree they are protected. But what if you're just looking for file backup or data backup? Well, the first option here is to use one of the many different cloud data protection solutions such as CrashPlan, Carbonite, AWS Storage Gateway and Microsoft Azure Backup. All of these are great options for replicating your files only up to the public cloud, but what if you have not just files, but virtual machines? So you can use disaster recovery in the cloud as well. So an entire virtual machine including the operating system applications and data would be replicated or copied in many cases with there frequently being as little as every 15 minutes. These are replicated or copied up to the public cloud and then solutions like Zerto, Veeam, and Infrascale and then provide you the ability to bring those machines up in the public cloud should your company have a disaster. The great thing about data protection in the cloud is like file backup to the cloud. You're only going to pay for what you consume and you're only going to pay in many cases if you actually have a disaster and have to bring up these virtual machines.

Summary
And with that we've reached the summary for this module. In this module we covered storage in the cloud, starting off with understanding your infrastructure-as-a-service storage options. We discussed how you can keep your data with the virtual machine instance or you can store your data external to that instance and that data could be kept in the local cloud, for example on Elastic Block Storage, or it could be kept remotely, but if you keep it remotely, keep in mind you may experience slow access to that data and you still need to protect that data in some way. From there we talked about cloud file storage options. Likely you're already familiar with things like G Drive, OneDrive, and Dropbox. After that we discussed object storage. Objects again are unstructured data like graphics from a website and the most well-known example of object storage is Amazon's S3. And then we wrapped this module up with data protection options in the cloud. You can use file backup protection services such as Carbonite or CrashPlan and then you have data protection options for entire datacenters that are running virtualization. Those virtual machines can be replicated up to the cloud, even datacenters that aren't 100% virtualized or who aren't even using virtualization can still use data protection from the public cloud and replicate their data up to the cloud and bring those virtual machines back up and running within minutes, should they have an actual disaster. So that's what you need to know about storage in the cloud, but what about infrastructure-as-a-service security? You may have heard that security in the cloud is of great concern. Well, let's talk about that in the next module. Thanks for watching.

Infrastructure as a Service: Security
Overview
Now if you've watched the news at all, you might have heard or you've probably heard about some cloud security concerns, some data breaches, some lost personal information. Now much of that was related to things that were totally unrelated to cloud computing. For example, a retailer with a credit card breach. However, many data breaches were directly related to cloud security. So when you think about moving to the cloud, you're smart to be concerned about security and that's exactly what we'll be talking about in this module. We'll kick it off with cloud security concerns. I'm going to list out some of the most common concerns and we'll do our best to address them. From there we'll talk about what encryption is and how it can help you. We'll cover compliance, what it is it and how it can help you. And then we'll wrap it up with vulnerabilities and mitigation in the cloud infrastructure.

Cloud Security Concerns
Whether you're an individual or a company and you're thinking about moving to the cloud, are you concerned about cloud security? Well, you should be. You should be concerned about availability and performance as well as cloud security. Cloud security is an important concern, but I would say it's just as important as other aspects like performance and availability. So speaking of cloud security concerns, here are some of the most common questions. Is my data safe? When I put it in the cloud, is it going to be safe? Who can see my data once I put it up there? Can my data be modified somehow? And who is responsible for security the data? Again, all common questions related to cloud security. Now the answer to many of these questions is found here. Unless you have managed security, the security of your data in the cloud is under what they call shared responsibility. That means that the responsibility to secure that data is between you and the cloud provider. In fact, Amazon says this right on their security web page. Here on the Amazon Cloud Security web page, as you can see, they have very thorough information related to security. They have information about penetration testing, security bulletins, resources, compliance, and partners who can help. They talk about the benefits of AWS Security. They put strong safeguards in place to protect their customer privacy. All data is stored in highly secure AWS datacenters that I'll tell you are most likely far more secure than whatever datacenter that you build at your company. AWS meets compliance requirements. Dozens of different compliance programs are met with the AWS infrastructure. AWS helps you to save money because you don't have to spend a fortune on security and at the same time you can still scale up quickly with AWS. So AWS has 42 availability zones and 16 geographic regions around the world. If we scroll on down, you can see here they help with compliance, they help with vulnerability reporting, they have expert guidance through both free support as well as professional services. So it's my opinion that you should feel safe putting your data in the cloud, but that you also want to be aware of the security responsibilities between you and the provider. You also need to take some time educating yourself on the resources that are available to you, on the security bulletins, on subscribing to the security bulletins, and perhaps working with a partner who can help you to accomplish many of these things.

Encryption
Now one of the ways to secure your data is called encryption. Now you may or may not have heard of encryption before. Encryption is the process of converting information or data into what they call ciphertext, which cannot be easily understood by anyone except those who have the key. So if you don't have the software key to some data that's encrypted, that data is just going to look like a bunch of gibberish. Once you have that software key, that data can be unlocked. Now many cloud providers give you the option to encrypt your data, whether it's in your virtual machines or if it's in some block or object storage, it can all be encrypted and then only you can have the key to unencrypt or decrypt that data.

Compliance
Something else to consider when it comes to cloud security is compliance. Many companies have compliance requirements. Examples of compliance that you need to follow are laws or regulatory compliance, depending on the type of business that you run. If you have healthcare data or credit card data or financial data, all of this may fall under specific laws that require you to protect that data in a certain way. You might have company requirements or policies or rules that require you to protect that data or treat it in a specific way. You might have standards for your industry or governance from your industry, maybe even regulations from let's say the IRS that require you to treat that data and report it, again in a specific way. If you go to AWS Security and into compliance for example, you can see here that AWS in this case is already compliant with numerous compliance programs and this can significantly reduce the amount of time that you have to spend in order for your company's on-premises datacenter to become compliant.

Vulnerabilities and Mitigation
Finally, when it comes to security, one of the things you need to take into consideration are vulnerabilities and mitigation. So a vulnerability is basically a hole that a malicious attacker could find in your infrastructure. It could be a database, it could be a virtual machine, it could be a web server. No matter what it is, the attacker has found a hole, a way in to gain access to some data or to make a change. With mitigation, you're monitoring these breaches as they come in and you're there to fend off the malicious attacker who's exploited some vulnerability. So when it comes to cloud computing, you want to ask questions like who keeps my operating systems and my applications up to date? Who's there to identify these vulnerabilities and offer some mitigation for me? Maybe your cloud provider provides this for you or maybe it's all up to you. Maybe it's totally your job. You also need to ask who performs backups of the data should something happen to that data and have those backups been tested. You'll want to ask who performs security scans of the virtual machines. When it comes to moving your data off-premises anywhere, whether it's cloud computing or something else, you need to make sure that you're comfortable with the security responsibilities. Who is doing what to ensure that your data is kept safe and secure? Cloud providers such as AWS allow you to report suspected vulnerabilities. They can analyze those vulnerabilities and identify them and help you to mitigate those vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.

Summary
And with that we've reached the summary for this module on infrastructure-as-a-service cloud security. We talked about cloud security concerns, things you need to be aware of when it comes to security related to moving to the cloud. Who's doing what? Where is the shared responsibility? You want make sure that understand what your cloud provider is doing and what they are not. We also talked about encryption as a possible way to protect your virtual machines that are running in the cloud. Encryption ensures that the virtual machines that you're running in the cloud and their associated data can't be viewed or tampered with. After that we talked about compliance and how cloud providers are in many cases already compliant and that could make your life far easier because you don't have to go out there and try to become compliant with your own datacenter. Many companies have legal and regulatory requirements that they must meet before they can move their virtual machines and their data to the public cloud. And then finally we wrapped it up by talking about vulnerabilities and mitigation. Who's going to identify the vulnerabilities in the operating systems and applications that are running in your cloud and who's going to mitigate those vulnerabilities? In other words, offer a solution for those vulnerabilities? And with that, thanks for watching this module on infrastructure-as-a-service cloud security. I hope you'll stay tuned for the next module in this course on comparing infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service. Thanks for watching!

Comparing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Overview
In this course we've talked a lot about infrastructure-as-a-service and only briefly mentioned platform-as-a-service or PaaS. So now let's talk about platform-as-a-service and how it compares specifically to infrastructure-as-a-service. In this module we'll cover what is platform-as-a-service and we'll answer that question first, before we talk about how infrastructure- as-a-service and platform-as-a-service compare. And then we'll wrap it up with a demo of Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk. We've got a lot to cover so let's get started.

What Is Platform as a Service?
Platform-as-a-service is for developers. That's one of the biggest differences between infrastructure-as-a- service and platform-as-a-service. Platform-as-a-service is for developers; infrastructure-as-a-service is for really any infrastructure people, but it could even be for developers who just want more control over the infrastructure. Let's talk a little bit more about platform-as-a-service. What is it? Well, it's a cloud service for developers primarily who want to be able to develop, run, and manage applications in the public cloud. With platform-as-a-service no servers, storage, networking, operating system, middleware or databases are needed. You don't have to install any of those if you're a developer and you want to deploy an application into a platform-as-a-service solution. Examples of platform-as-a-service are Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk, which I'll show you in just a moment, Microsoft Azure App Service, Google App Engine, Cloud Foundry, and Heroku. These are all popular examples of platform-as-a-service solutions.

How Do IaaS and PaaS Compare?
So to detail out the difference here between infrastructure-as-a- service and platform-as-a-service, first off with infrastructure-as-a- service you're going to be provided through the cloud provider all servers, storage, and networking. You don't have to provide any of those but you will have to install in many cases an operating system or that operating system will already be provided in the image that you're running. Whether you're a developer or an admin, you're going to have to install your own software such as web servers, database servers, and so forth to run in the infrastructure-as-a-service cloud. Now platform-as-a-service on the other hand, runs on top of infrastructure-as-a-service. So you don't have to purchase infrastructure-as-a-service, you just purchase PaaS as it's called, and the platform-as-a-service includes the infrastructure as well as web servers, database servers, and development libraries that developers might need. So there's nothing for them to deploy or install; simply develop, run, and deploy your application on the platform-as-a-service solution. Now I'd like to do a fun little comparison between infrastructure-as- a-service and platform-as-a-service and even software-as-a-service using this Pizza as a Service analogy. So there's a guy named Albert Barron; he's a senior software client architect at IBM and he made this great blog post out here on LinkedIn that you see on the screen and if you scroll down, he talks about the differences here, but he's got this really awesome diagram called Pizza as a Service. So let me zoom in in here. So in the diagram you can see on the left-hand side we have traditional on-premises or on-prem infrastructure and this is really like made-at-home pizza. So with made-at-home pizza you go to the grocery store and you get all the different toppings, right? Cheese, tomato sauce, pizza dough and you put it in your own oven and you eat it at your own table. So essentially you've done everything yourself on the left with the traditional on-premises infrastructure. And then if you move up from there, this is where we start talking about public cloud. So the next column here is infrastructure-as-a- service or IaaS. With infrastructure-as-a-service this is kind of like the take-and-bake pizza idea. With take-and-bake pizza you go out to a store. They have created a pizza already for you. They create it for you as you would like with whatever toppings you like. You bring it home, you throw it in your oven and 15 minutes later, you're eating pizza at your dinner table that you didn't really have to make, you just fired it up yourself, right? And that's kind of like infrastructure-as-a-service. And then Albert goes on here to compare that to platform-as-a-service. So with platform-as-a-service, this is like getting pizza delivered. With pizza being delivered, you just call a number, the pizza company brings it right out, delivers it to your door, you eat it at your own table. And then finally there is software-as-a-service or SaaS. So with software-as-a-service this is really like dining out. You go out, you sit down at a pizza restaurant, you order whatever pizza you want and you eat it right there; they do everything for you. So I think this is a really good comparison here, all the way from traditional on-premises infrastructure where you do everything yourself. That's like made-at-home pizza to infrastructure-as-a-service where a cloud provider provides the infrastructure and you consume it as virtual machines, that's like take-and-bake. And then platform-as-a-service where they provide not only the infrastructure, but also some form of software platform. So it could be let's say the web server infrastructure or database infrastructure where you simply put your code on top of it and then you can run your applications from there. That's like getting pizza delivered. And then finally software-as-a-service where essentially they do everything for you over the internet through the cloud. You simply use the application you want to use. It could be Office 365, it could be Gmail. Whatever it is, you're simply consuming it and that's like having pizza in a restaurant. So that's the Pizza as a Service analogy. Between pizza and cloud service, it's very cool stuff. Thanks, Albert! With that let's move on to our demo of Amazon's platform-as-a-service Elastic Beanstalk.

Demo AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Alright, it's everyone's favorite time, it's demo time. Now it's time to go out to Amazon's platform-as-a-service, which is called Elastic Beanstalk. We're going to check it out and I'm going to show you what it would be like to get started with Elastic Beanstalk. Here in my AWS console I'm just going to go up to my services and over to Elastic Beanstalk. It has a funny name, but it's a really cool platform-as-a-service solution. Now there is some very nice Getting Started with Elastic Beanstalk documentation that you can check out over here. It walks you through the whole process and that's exactly what I'm going to show you now. If we go back here to our Elastic Beanstalk console, it says no environments currently exist for this application. I'm going to click Create one now and it talks about here how we can create new environments. One option for a new environment is a web server, another option is a worker environment. All of these include load balancing and auto scaling. I'm going to click create web server and then let's select a platform. So take a look at this. Our Elastic Beanstalk environment is going to provide not only a web server, but also the binary libraries that we need to run any of these different types of application platforms.. NET, Java, Node. js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Tomcat. You can read them for yourself. The point here is that there are a lot of different choices that you can configure your Elastic Beanstalk environment to run. In our case let's go ahead and do Docker and click Next. We're going to have a sample application. We can scroll here through the deployment preferences and click Next. Here we need to select the name for the environment. I'll check availability for that. I'm going to add my initials afterwards and it looks like we're good to go. I'll click Next, Next. We'll select a key pair. Scroll down here, click Next, Next, Next. Here we get a final review. We'll click Launch and it took a few minutes, but our new Elastic Beanstalk platform-as-a-service, auto scaling, highly available application was successfully deployed in Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk. You can see here the health of the application. We chose the Docker platform and if we scroll down, you can see the recent events here, everything that it took to build this auto-scaling application in Elastic Beanstalk was successful. We can test the application by clicking on the URL up here and as you can see, congratulations! Your Docker container is now running in Elastic Beanstalk on your own dedicated environment in the AWS Cloud. There's access here to sample applications. There are some videos you can watch as well as the documentation. So that's how easy it is to use a platform-as-a-service solution or I should say at least to get started with a platform-as-a-service since we didn't actually develop anything in this case, but the point being that platform-as-a-service solutions are very easy to get started with even for non-developers such as myself. Thanks for watching the demo. Let's wrap up this module.

Summary
And with that we've reached the end of this module. In this module you learned what at PaaS is or a platform-as-a-service cloud computing solution. Platform-as-a-service solutions are primarily for developers, developers who very easily want to develop, run, and deploy a new application in the cloud. From there you learned how infrastructure-as-a-service and platform- as-a-service solutions compare. Primarily, platform-as-a-service solutions give developers exactly what they need to build and deploy their applications. And then we wrapped up this module with a demo of the Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk platform-as-a-service solution. Thanks for watching this module. Stay tuned for our next module on software-as-a-service cloud solutions.

Software as a Service (SaaS) Cloud Solutions
Overview
Software-as-a-service or SaaS solutions, they are by far the easiest way to consume cloud computing and that's exactly what we'll be talking about in this module. We'll kick it off with the benefits of SaaS cloud solutions before we jump into some demos. I'll demo Office 365, the Google G Suite, and SalesForce. com. We've got a lot to cover so let's get started.

Benefits of SaaS Cloud Solutions
Think about it for a minute. How many software-as-a-service solutions do you use now? What about for your bookkeeping? What about for your bill payment? What about for your file storage or maybe your offsite backup of your family photos? What about backing up your iPhone or your Android phone? Perhaps you store your music library or your video library up in the cloud. How many different software-as-a-service solutions do you use on a daily basis? I'd be willing to bet that it's more than 5 for most people out there. So why are software-as-a-service solution so popular? Well, let's talk about the benefits of SaaS solutions for just a moment. First off, there's no hardware to buy or install. If you're a small business and you want to deploy a basic bookkeeping application, instead of purchasing a server to share the files for the bookkeeping application and store those files, instead of installing an operating system, buying a bookkeeping application and installing it, maintaining it, upgrading it, what if you simply went to the cloud? That way you wouldn't have any hardware to buy or install, no software to buy or install, no software to maintain or upgrade over the years, and even better, what if you only paid for what you used? What if you just had two or three bookkeepers who needed access to the software? There's no need to purchase a shared server just for those bookkeepers and maintain all the software. What if you simply paid a yearly or monthly membership for those two or three bookkeepers to access the bookkeeping software that you need? And even better, what if the new features just simply came out every month or every quarter or even every year and those features were simply included and automatically added onto the software-as-a-service solution? And to me, one of the great things about SaaS solutions is they make these large enterprise-grade applications available to just about everyone out there. SaaS solutions really level the playing field between the large enterprises and the small business person. And with that, let's jump into some demos. I want to show you some of the most popular SaaS solutions in the world today.

Demo Office 365
In our first demo I'd like to show you Office 365. I know we touched on this earlier, but I want to make sure that you're familiar with everything that Office 365 can do for you because I believe this is one of the best software-as-a-service solutions available today for small, medium, even large-sized businesses. Let's check it out. Office 365 comes in a variety of different packages. If we go in here and take a look at the plans and pricing, you can see it ranges between $5 and $12 per user per month, and for home packages you can get it between $69 and $99 per year. But back here to the business, if we scroll down you can see there's Business, there's Business Premium, and Business Essentials. Different packages come with different applications. Here you can see the different Office applications that are included in the different packages. OneDrive for the cloud file sharing like we talked about earlier, and then services. Services like Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, and Skype for Business. You also get business-class email addresses with your company's domain name and much, much more. We can scroll down here. It goes down quite a ways. So that's how Office 365 is packaged. What if we now log into Office 365? Here in the Office 365 administrative center, this is where I can add and remove users, I can add and remove domains, I can install software locally, and then of course I can access the numerous different applications that I have access to. For example, let's go into Microsoft Excel. You can see here I can, for example, add a new blank workbook. And using Excel Online I can create spreadsheets just as if I were running Excel locally. Same thing for Word Online and all the other traditional Office applications that I'm used to using. So that's Office 365, a complete online Office suite for individuals, for students, as well as for small, medium, and even large enterprises.

Demo Google G Suite
Now it's time for another demo. In this demo I'm going to show you the Google G Suite as it's called. Let's check it out. The Google G Suite, similar to the Office 365 package is a suite of Office applications. With that G Suite that includes Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Calendar. If we take a look at the features up here, you can see Gmail of course is for email, calendar. You've got conferencing here with Hangouts. You can store files in the cloud with Drive and then you've got Google's version of the traditional Microsoft Office Suite. The word processor is Docs, Sheets is your spreadsheet, Forms, Slides, is similar to PowerPoint, and more. So if we log in, we can access the G Suite administrative console. We can see our users, and then we can see our applications that are available here. So of course email, calendar, Drive. Let's go into Docs. And here you can see it's very similar to for example, Word Online. I'm editing a word processing document here, all in my web browser. In fact, if we close this out, we can go back here and let's go into Sheets, which is again, very similar to Microsoft Excel. I know they don't like me to say that, but hey, that's what we all started with is Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word in the business and now we have a number of different software-as-a- service applications available over the web and in this case we're looking specifically at Office applications. The G Suite versus Office 365. Alright, so that's the Google G Suite. It's a very simple, very easy to use Office productivity suite for individuals as well as small and even all the way up to large businesses. With that let's move on and look at another demo.

Demo Salesforce.com
In this final demo I want to show you SalesForce. com. I talked about it in the history of cloud computing as being the first ever software-as-a-service application that really gained critical mass. So let's go check it out, SalesForce. com. As I said earlier, SalesForce. com is a CRM or a customer relationship management tool. It's typically used by salespeople, but it can be used by really any company that wants to maintain a relationship with their customers. Now traditionally installing a CRM at a company could cost thousands, tens of thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars, and it took many months, but if we go in here to the pricing and take a look at SalesForce. com, you can see here you can get started with SalesForce. com for just $25 per user in blocks of 5. So for $125 per month I can get started with a CRM that really is enterprise grade, and they have many different forms of SalesForce. com as you can see on the left here. Sales Cloud, Sales and Service, Marketing, Application, Community, Wave Analytics, Health, and much more. I'm not familiar with all of these, but the point being that SalesForce. com, the original CRM has been modified and customized to meet the needs of many different types of use cases. So let's go ahead and give it a try. If we log in here, we're going to connect with LinkedIn and there we go. We're in SalesForce. com. We can take a tour of how it works if we'd like to do that here, or simply close that out and you can see we've got some demo data in here, some dummy data so that we can get started using SalesForce. com as a customer relationship management tool. We get this free 30-day trial and gain access to an application even just as an individual that was traditionally only available to large businesses and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. Alright so that was SalesForce. com, the first software-as-a-service application to really gain critical mass and still one of the most popular software-as-a-service applications available today. With that we've reached the end of this module; let's wrap it up.

Summary
And with that we've reached the summary for this module. We talked about the benefits of SaaS cloud solutions or software-as-a-service. I bet almost everyone out there is already using a SaaS application in some way, shape or form and yes, that does include Gmail. com and Dropbox. From there I demo'd a few different SaaS solutions, Office 365, the Google G Suite, and SalesForce. com, the original SaaS application. Thanks for watching this module on software-as-a-service cloud solutions. Stay tuned for the course summary.

Summary
What You Learned in This Course
Congratulations! You've reached the summary for this course on Cloud Computing Fundamentals. What have you learned? I hope you've learned a lot, but let me try to summarize what you should've learned. First off, you should've learned the basics of the cloud. What is the cloud? It's a service that someone else performs for you in a remote site, across the internet in most cases where some computing pool is shared to run your applications or your virtual machines or to provide you some platform for web development. There are a lot of benefits of using the cloud of course. It's self-service, it's elastic, it scales up, it scales down and you only pay for what you use. You don't have any initial large capital expenditures and you can get up and running very, very quickly. It can make your company more efficient. It has the potential to save your company money or even make your company money and it makes your life as an administrator far easier. Of course we learned that there are numerous forms of the cloud. There is infrastructure-as-a-service or IaaS as it's called, which runs virtual machines and containers. There's platform-as-a-service or PaaS, which provides developers the platforms they need to get up and running faster than ever before. And then there's software-as-a-service or SaaS. Software-as-a-service, for example SalesForce. com, Microsoft 365, and Google Docs are all SaaS applications that are very, very popular. Now like I said at the start of the course, if you have questions, I encourage you to use first the course discussion. I'll be monitoring those discussions for your question. If that doesn't work, you can reach out to me on Twitter or if you just have something nice to say, feel free. Ping me on Twitter, I'm always monitoring Twitter and I would love to hear your feedback about this course or others. You can always reach me on my blog as well; it's DavidMDavis. com. Thanks so much for watching this course on Cloud Computing Fundamentals. I hope that you go out and use the cloud to make your life easier and to help your company. Thanks for watching and have a great day!
