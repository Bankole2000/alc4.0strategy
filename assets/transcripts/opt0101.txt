Course Introduction
Course Introduction
Hello everyone. My name is Doru Catana, and welcome to my course How to Stay Abreast in the Ever-changing World of Tech. In this course, we'll cover a topic on everyone's mind at some point in their career, how to keep up and stay relevant. How do you keep your skills sharp, choose the right technology to learn, find new techniques, use new frameworks, and just be on top of everything while at the same time you need to do your job and have time for family and friends? But before we start talking about the how, let's look at the why. And here your reasons can be any of the following. Maybe you want to earn more. More skill usually translates to better earnings. Maybe you want a new job and are working towards acquiring new skills. That again is a valid reason. Or maybe you just value stability and want to be able to maintain your current position. But in today's world, even maintaining requires a lot of work. The IT industry is one of the most dynamic and rapid-growing ones, and if you don't keep up you will become obsolete fast. Or maybe you just want to achieve expert status and want to earn the respect and trust of your peers. These are all good reasons to stay sharp. And you'll agree with me that across all of them the only constant is change. The era where you did the same thing for 40 years then you retired is long gone. Learning must be an integral part of your career. But although apparently difficult, it doesn't have to be a burden, and that's the mission of this course, to help you stay ahead with minimal effort. And here's how we plan to do just that. Like every great lesson, we first go over the fundamental principles because if you get these right, even if you forget the technique or a specific resources change, you know how to reconstruct your systems independently. Then we go over something I think every professional should have some minimal knowledge on, the science of learning: how the brain works, how it gathers and stores information, and also how you access it when needed. We don't look just at the theory of things, everything will be centered around practicality and how you can apply the techniques right away. Once we cover this module on learning, which I am convinced you'll love, we're going to jump right onto the core of the course, putting in the right systems. We will look at both online and offline tactics, I'll share how to search for relevant forums, communities, podcasts, how to find influences in your industry, and of course e-learning platforms. Then, we'll look at meet-ups, conferences, and events. And for all of them we'll look at the pros, the cons, and even recommend some specific models by which you can schedule your time. After you learn how to build your own system, we'll look at industry-specific resources with several examples like front-end development or creative. Any the end of the course, you will have the fundamental principles by which to build your staying-relevant system, core strategies and techniques to optimize your learning, and a framework to have a constant flow of information that is void of clutter, redundancy, and irrelevant content. You'll learn new skills faster and even create authority status in the industry if that's your goal. I hope you're as eager to start this course as I was making it, and I bet you'll be using it for years to come. That being said, let's go to the next module, Core Strategies.

Core Strategies
Move Your Feet
Module 2: Core Strategies. In this module, we'll cover the fundamental principles that will allow you to set in place the right systems to stay ahead of the curve. If you remember nothing else from this course except these five principles, you'll always be able to create the systems to stay and continue to grow and learn. Still, I highly recommend you watch the entire course because in each module you have unique and valuable information to learn. I've compiled a list from a few hundred personal stories from successful professionals from the tech scene. What I ask of you is not to ignore the profoundness due to their simplicity. And although in this particular case they're applied to tech professionals, they can be used in any walk of life and are pretty much universal. Without any more delays, I'll introduce the first one. It's called move your feet. The initial story is from Hacker News written by developer Matt Swanson where he shares a comment from a trainer when he was trying to determine the optimal brand of running shoes. That comment was, Wanna know the secret of improving your running? Move your feet. This came after several months where he had set himself two goals: learn how to write tests for his Rails project and start running. For the first goal, he read several books, watched screencasts, online courses, best practices tutorials, but didn't get to actually writing code. For the second one he simply started running. Quite badly at first, but saw consistent progress each week. The results speak for themselves. Goal number one, zero specs in his Rails project, goal number 2, 866 miles traveled by foot that year. And the reason this is the first principle is because throughout this course I will share dozens of resources and systems for you to set in place, but if all you do is read, listen, watch tutorials, news, podcasts you won't get the results you want. Execution is where the magic happens. Michael Jordan didn't win six NBA championships for knowledge of the game alone. He practiced and practiced and practiced. And let's get one thing straight, you'll never be prepared especially when jumping to a new technology where you start from scratch. It's natural to feel angst, frustration, and even anger when you go from being on top of something to 0. And this is perfectly normal. In the book Flow, author Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi explained that flow happens when high skill meets high challenge level. But whenever you learn something new you instantly go to low skill, and that's where anxiety and worry happen. And since we're on the topic of challenges, that's what the next principle is all about, solving a problem. So I'm looking forward to see you in the next video.

Solve a Problem
Solve a problem. If you look at the world of business or tech at the core what every company solves is a problem. The need that the end users sometimes didn't even know they had. That's why this principle is extremely effective in your search to have relevant skills and stay ahead. Your learning efforts are much more powerful when they have a clear purpose. If you're at a point in your career where you've already mastered the language, then you should focus on optimizing it. If you're just starting out, no problem. Karan Goel, an engineer at Google, compiled a mega list of projects that you can solve in any programming language to get started. You can find it on GitHub. You have everything from numbers, classic algorithms, graphs, data structure, networking, classes, threading, files, databases, graphics, and security. And I'm sure you can find something similar for any industry you're in. So if you don't know where to start, try something like that. Another option is to build your own project that will make life easier when you do another task. Build tools that will help you later. While the first principle handled the how, this one handles the what. Long story short, remember that the fastest way to learn and grow is to have a clear goal on what problem you want to solve. And since we mentioned speed that will be our next principle. There is no speed limit. So I'm looking forward to see you in the next video.

There Is No Speed Limit
There is no speed limit. This story was originally written by Derek Sivers, an Entrepreneur from the U. S., where he shares his experience meeting Kimo Williams, an American musician, that promised to teach him two years of theory at Berkley in just a few lessons. Derek called a local recording studio and asked a random question on music typesetting. The studio owner heard he was going to Berkley and offered to teach him two years of theory in just a few lessons and said he could graduate in just two years if he understood there is no speed limit. Kimo told him to come by his studio at 9:00 AM. At 8:59 he rang the doorbell. Kimo opened and with a huge smile he was sizing him up and nodding and telling him that he keeps making the same offer, but nobody ever comes. After a 1 minute welcome, they start working. As Derek says in his blog post, the pace was intense and I loved it. Finally, someone was challenging me, keeping me in over my head, encouraging and expecting me to pull myself up quickly. I was learning so fast it had the adrenaline of sports or a video game. In that one 3 hour session he learned a full semester of Berkley's harmony courses. The moral is that it's all about your expectations and the standard pace is designed so anyone can keep up. But if you're more driven, you can do so much more than anybody else expects, provided you accept the fact that there is no speed limit and you're influenced by a great teacher. And that leads us to the next core principle, get yourself a mentor.

Get Yourself a Mentor
Get yourself a mentor. Since Greek philosophers, the value of a mentor has always been underestimated. 2000 years later the rules still apply. A mentor, or at least emulating someone who is now where you want to be at some point in the future, is the fastest way to success. A mentor will laugh at problems you consider impossible and it will speed up your learning process and make it less frustrating and more challenging. Ideal mentors are colleagues, preferably significantly more experienced than you, but also people that you can frequently interact with either offline or online. In future modules, we'll talk more about this and how to get the most out of your mentor without being disruptive to his or her schedule. In case you struggle in finding one or you don't feel any form of synergy with the ones that offered to coach you, an alternative is a community of like-minded people where different perspectives and backgrounds will help you solve problems faster. You can find these people either on blogs and forums, but the most effective way is to either search for or establish a local community and have weekly or monthly meet-ups. The exchange of ideas will help you to stay on track with industry changes, new technologies, and can even offer career opportunities. That being said, we'll jump to the fifth and last principle, which comes full circle. It's called teach.

Teach
Teach. There's something about having to explain to someone a concept that makes it clearer and easier understood by the teacher during the process. Don't believe me? Try this simple experiment. The next time you go to an event or a training session or watch an online course, watch it as if your responsibility was to teach it and explain it to someone else afterwards. And do just that. Make a presentation of it and present it either to your team, to a friend, or your significant other. You will see that your level of attention and your focus will be two or three notches higher than before. And this is not a new principle. Again, we can go back to antiquity with Seneca who said, while we teach, we learn. Recent studies show that students who teach others score higher, this being called the protégé effect. And there are many factors that lead to this. For starters, your circle of influence significantly increases when you are responsible for someone else understanding the information you share. Also, you will look at it from multiple perspectives and identify several ways to transfer your knowledge. That again gives you a much higher level of understanding of the concept. And finally, you're emotionally linked to your students getting satisfaction when they understand your explanations and being frustrated if they don't. And teaching doesn't need to be solely in this traditional form, teaching can be posting a blog post where you share your experience on a specific problem. Teaching can mean publishing a plugin, toolkit, something that will help others solve a problem or avoid it altogether. And before we end this module, I'd like to quickly go over all the principles once more. First, you must move your feet. Learning without doing is just another name for paralysis by analysis. It's working that gets things moving, not information alone. Second, solve a problem. Without a clear aim, you won't build something worthwhile and your research will be just a masked form of procrastination. Third, remember there is no speed limit. Learn x in 21 days doesn't have to take 21 days. If you can do it in 5, do it in 5. And forth, get yourself a mentor. And if you don't find someone more skilled than you, create or join a group of like-minded people to accelerate your growth. And the fifth and last principle, teach. There is no better way of understanding a new concept than sharing it with someone else. Coming up next, we have a module that I'm convinced you'll love. It's about the science of learning. You'll discover how your brain learns, stores, and accesses information. So I'm looking forward to see you in the next module.

How Learning Works and How to Optimize It
How Learning Works
Module 3: How Learning Works and How to Optimize It. And the way I want to analyze this is the same way Elon Musk said he approaches new things, from principles up. Because a lot of the times the status quo is flawed in some way or misunderstood, but principles never change. As we established earlier, the goal of this course is for you to stay up-to-date with new technologies and keep your skillset fresh. And what that boils down to is learning and memorizing new information. That's why this module exists, so you better understand how learning works and how to optimize it to spend minimum effort for maximum result. Learning is the act of acquiring new or modifying and reinforcing existing knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, and preferences. It's a process used in education, personal development, and training in general. Interest towards learning has existed since forever. In fact, both Plato and Aristotle have several writings on the topic of learning. What they both emphasized on was learning by doing, something I think you already got from one of the core principles enunciated in the previous module. Plato wrote quite a lot on the topic of education, pointing out the importance of it being voluntary, prohibiting the usage of force, and also focusing on the importance of the teacher who is the torch bearer that needs not only in-depth knowledge of the topic, but also high integrity and a pleasing personality. But let's get back to the present day. There are many forms of learning. One of which is also play. We've all used it when growing up. We learned about gravity when we threw in the air a toy and saw it come back down. We learned about temperature when we first touched something hot or frozen, but we didn't look at it as learning because it was constant play. That's why if you look from a different perspective at one of the principles mentioned in the previous module a great way to learn a new programming language, for example, or to use a new tool is by creating something you enjoy building. This way it's closer to play and further from soul-crushing work. There are many types of learning, some more effective than others. Some associative, some non-associative. For example, you have habituation where a repeated stimulus makes us learn. In fact I remember a quote from Stephen Covey: First we make our habits, then our habits make us. So believe it or not, having good habits plays a fundamental role in the effectiveness of your learning techniques. And you'll see for yourself how I integrated this in the staying up-to-date system we'll work on in the upcoming modules. Then, we have classical conditioning with Pavlov's dog, which we all heard of. And there are many more learning types, some more effective than others, that you will be able to experiment with by the end of this module. But before we get to that point, I'd like to look at the factors that influence learning in the following video. So I'm looking forward to see you there.

Factors That Influence Learning
Factors that influence learning, and we'll split them in two categories: external and internal. And we'll start with heredity, basically the predisposition to learn faster than others. I'm not a believer that anyone can do anything. While I do believe that through hard work and focus you can excel in any field, I do think that we are all different and we each have different strengths in some areas and weaknesses in others. I talked about this view of things in my personality test course with the strength finder 2. 0 behavior assessment tool. We all have specific innate talents, and it's much more rewarding to allocate time and effort to a talent and transform it into a strength than to try and be the best at something that you start out with a disadvantage. So yes, like it or not, some people will learn faster than you and there's nothing you can do about it on the genetic side of things. But don't worry, there's plenty of room for improvement with all the other factors. Still on the external side of things, we have your environment. And here you have everything from your nutrition, to your lighting, again, practically everything that's outside influencing inside. Noise, light, distractions, stress, furniture, comfort, they all influence the effectiveness of your learning. In fact, here's a quick little experiment that I want you to try out this week for at least half a day. If you're like most people, you have plenty of distractions when you work, be it your phone ringing, numerous notifications, coworkers, meetings, everything interrupts you. Try to have at least 3 hours where all you do is focus on a particular project you want to get done. That's it, just 3 hours with 0 interruptions. You'll be amazed by how much you get done. In fact, I am even willing to bet you will get more done than you do in an average full day of work. The concept behind this is the stay out of the gray zone. A place that we are all guilty of being in occasionally. When we are working we're not fully focused on work, being distracted, or focusing on other things as well. And when we're relaxing we're focusing on work projects so not fully relaxing. And this influences learning enormously. But enough about external factors let's transition to the internal ones. Here we have goals. Yes, setting goals is very important because learning can be a very blurry activity if you don't have a clear outcome as to what you want to achieve. Simplest way to maximize your goal setting is by using the SMART acronym: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time bound. All your goals need to have these elements. Moving forward with internal learning factors, we have motivation. As a Ted Talk I recently watched said, learning is easy, getting yourself motivated and in a position to start learning is the hard part. And it's influenced by a plethora of factors, but what's most important is the answer to the question, why? Why do you want to do this? Why is it important for you to stay ahead? And answering this question truthfully will make all the difference. The following factor is interest, and this is quite straightforward. The more interest you have for a topic, the easier the learning process is. Then, there's attention. Which if you block out all the interruptions and distractions, like I said earlier, you have it solved. Another factor is practice. Again we see the principle of learning by doing, and if you don't implement any new information you got the impact on your growth will be far less. Then, we have fatigue, which although internal is influenced by the environment a lot, so make sure you're well rested when learning new things. While motivation and drive will compensate for fatigue, the physics of how learning works and memories form says that the more rested you are the better will the process of forming memories work. Then we have guidance. And here we have a mentor or a tutor or the learning resources you have access to. The role of a mentor is to inspire, to create interest and accountability, so make sure to keep an eye on these aspects when choosing one. And last, but not least, we have emotional conditions. Long story short, the more intense and positive your emotion towards learning, the higher the likelihood of learning faster and the information lasting longer and being more easily accessible. If you want to find out more about the correlation between emotions, learning, and habit creation, I recommend you read the book, Release Your Brakes by James Newman. And now, we'll move on to the last part of this module: Best Practices. So I'm looking forward to see you there.

Best Practices
After we looked at the fundamental principles, it's time to pay close attention to practices. The first one I want to talk about is evidence based education since it's mostly targeted at group learning and most of us work in teams. Rarely are we technological hermits. So here are the proven methods of evidence based education. First, use analogies and similes. And this works because it's much easier to link new information to existing ones than starting from scratch. The neuro pathways are already there, you just adapt and expand them. Then, there is note making and summarizing. And this works because it's easier for the brain to simulate new information if it's well organized. You no longer need to learn three paragraphs, but three simple ideas. Another very important method is having a growth mindset. Since you're watching this course, I think you already have this working for you; however, if helping a colleague or if you want to implement this in your organization, set aside a few hours each week for learning and sharing new information, new practices and methods to optimize productivity. You can do something like growth Thursdays where every Thursday after lunch a team member shares something for 20 minutes then you all discuss the topic and identify ways of implementing the new strategy, tool, or technique in your business. Then we have repetition and practice. And I can't stress enough the importance of this. It makes all the difference. It's like reading about football and actually playing it. Of course reading helps and it will speed up your learning curve, but doing is what counts. Cooperative learning is yet another great practice where if done in teams it's proven to be very effective. The reason being that some ideas might be more easily understood by some members and harder by others. So instead of getting stuck, cooperation helps speed up the process for everyone. And I'm not even mentioning the impact on team synergy and interpersonal relationships. Another core method to evidence based education is setting goals. We already discussed that in this module, so we'll jump to the next one, which is hypothesis testing. It's extremely effective in improving existing systems with new ideas. You are far more likely to remember something you tested yourself in comparison to reading somewhere that it works or it doesn't. And as you can see, all these methods have overlapping areas. That's why what I encourage you to do as a practical exercise is to pick just three of them. So pause the video, pick your favorite ones, and try integrating them whenever the need for learning occurs. You'll be amazed by the impact they have on your effectiveness, and also you will see that they will branch out into hybrid methods that support and improve each other. Another great practice we're learning again in that group learning is cognitive acceleration. This not only develops your learning ability, but also critical thinking. You start out by setting the scene. This is the stage where you identify the resources the learning group has available. For example, your team might want to develop a new software. You first look at what you have, resources, knowledge, manpower, then you identify the challenge, what exactly you want to achieve. And if you want this to be a learning experience, you need to make the challenge above the current level of knowledge or expertise. Then you have the group brainstorm and get to work where everyone suggests ideas, shares solutions and tactics for implementation. Make sure you encourage even incomplete ideas because they might serve as clues for the other group members in identifying the best solution. Once that is done, it's time for the plenary where you all share the ideas and decide on a path. You choose the right solution, weighing pros and cons or by doing SWAT analysis for some decisions. And a very important action during the plenary is to pay attention to metacognition. More precisely, how did you get to that outcome or solution because in time you might forget specific results, but if you remember the train of thought that got you there you will always easily have access to the idea. And the last stage is bridging. And here you will need to link the knowledge acquired to existing know-how because in isolation knowledge is rapidly lost. A good exercise to practice with your team is to identify other areas where you can use the new acquired information and what other project, existing or future, would it be valuable for. And that's all you need to know on cognitive acceleration to start applying it. As you can see, it's not so different from the numerous management techniques or project briefings, it's merely a new layer added on top of what you're already doing. A layer that makes everything a structured learning experience as well. The third practice to improve your learning is as often neglected as it is simple. We're talking about sleep. We all know it's good, yet we all cut important chance of it, thinking we get more value for our time if we do something else. I'm not going to talk too much about the science of sleep because there are plenty of resources on that topic, countless documentaries and studies. The consensus is that sleep, the quantity and quality of it, impact almost every aspect of your life. So let's take a closer look at the relation between sleep and learning. Research indicates that sleep aides in the consolidation of long term memory. On one hand, we have REM sleep, which helps with non-declarative memories such as your typing speed or ability to cycle. Then, we have non-REM sleep, which is associated with declarative memories such as remembering facts and specific things like dates, formulas, or algorithms. Sleep helps the brain edit its memory, identifying important patters, extracting overarching rules and principles, basically it gives you the gist. So next time you say to yourself, I'll read one more hour then go to bed, think twice and maybe go to bed early to consolidate information you already have rather than risk losing more than you potentially gain. And the last practice that is especially helpful when getting into a new technology or when you need to dive into something fast and time is not on your side is the rapid skill acquisition method. I first heard it in a Ted Talk by Josh Kaufman where he explains that to get decently good at something you need no more than 20 hours of deliberate, focused practice. I highly encourage you to go see the entire Ted Talk the next time you take a quick break. We've all been bombarded with the 10, 000 hours concept, yet what we all forget is that you need 10, 000 hours to be in the top 1% in any industry. When first starting out with any technology or any new skill you don't need 10, 000 hours to be decently good. And that's what Josh Kaufman argues, that you only need 20 hours to get decent if you follow these 5 steps. First, get your tools ready. Then, deconstruct the skill. What are the components of that new skill? Identify each and every one of them. Step number three, learn enough to self-correct. Four, reduce practice barriers. And here we're not talking environment alone, also emotional barriers. If you keep telling yourself something is impossible, guess what, it is impossible. As Stephen Covey said in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People argue for your weaknesses and they're yours. So try to have a positive and empowering look at learning new things. And the last and most important step is 20 hours of focused, deliberate practice. And it's as simple as that. And you just reached the end of this module. I've tried to be as practical as possible, taking only the essential from the theory and aiming on what you can integrate in your daily activities right away to get more results. If you want more in-depth knowledge on the topic, make sure to check the resources I mentioned. That being said, we'll move on to what I consider the core of this course, creating the systems to stay ahead in the ever-changing world of tech. I'm looking forward to see you in the next module.

Setting up Your Systems
The SUN - Staying up to Date System
Setting up your systems. Consider this module and the next one the hands on part of the course where you set up all the systems that will allow you to stay updated, grow your skillset, and even get yourself to authority status if that's your aim. Before proceeding, I'd like to point out that you will never achieve perfection. There is no such thing as knowing everything. And statements like I want to learn this are too vague and will lead to paralysis by analysis. Ultimately, everything you know should serve a purpose. In general, that purpose is implementing a solution efficiently. So, think of yourself as a perpetual beta program that keeps getting better and better yet is never fully complete. Now let's proceed. There are three aspects to staying ahead, and since I've heard somewhere that acronyms are easy to remember I named this the SUN system, more precisely, skill acquisition, updates, and networking. Skill acquisition is when you either want to learn a completely new skill or improve a specific area of an existing one. This should be a constant in your career and you should always have at least a few hours allocated each week for it, even if you're at the top of your game. Updates is having a bird's eye view of all the changes in your industry from framework updates, different approaches to things, technology changes that favor or make some existing strategies obsolete. Simply said, the news. And then networking, which is another essential part that has some not so obvious benefits yet extremely valuable. Most of the times, you won't hear new things at conferences and meet-ups, things that you haven't heard already from an online source. But here's what you could get potential partners for when you get a bigger project that you can't handle, new job opportunities in case you don't feel a culture fit with your existing team, and even a different way of doing things to maximize productivity, profits, or how rewarding or purposeful your work feels. We'll cover each of these components in the next section of the module with actionable items so you can have a working system by the end of the course. While implementing this system, don't forget that everything you do should still follow the principles we discussed earlier. That beings said, coming up next we have skill acquisition.

Skill Acquisition
Skill acquisition is when you use resources with the sole focus of getting a new skill or improving an existing one. And here you have two scenarios, when you want to learn a completely new skill and start from scratch. In this case, you usually get a book or a course and start with something like essentials of so and so. Then move on to more advanced courses like hands-on training for so and so. And depending on your specific aim, you move to a sub category for what you need. This scenario is more explorative and the path depends a lot on what you want to achieve. The beauty is in the fact that you don't know how much you don't know. And you will start to make connections and associations with different technologies, which will help you speed up the process because you're building on an existing structure. The most effective method here are e-learning platforms. And guess what? You're already on one doing exactly what I'm preaching in this course. That's why I'd like to share some insight as an instructor present on multiple platforms always pay for the content. I'm not saying this from the point of view that authors should be paid for their work and effort, although that's a valid argument as well, I'm telling you to pay for the training because if it's free you won't use it. As I said, I have courses on multiple platforms. Many with a paper course model, not memberships, and the completion rate for paying students is 80% and for those that got the course for free it's below 5% because if you don't have any skin on the line, you won't commit. And even if one of the driving emotions of you getting where you want in your career is guilt because you paid for something and should use it, I say good. Getting something for free will reduce your perception of the value you've just received and neglect its importance. The more you pay, the better. Just think about it, how much more focused would you have been right now if you would have paid $1000 for this course? Odds are you'd be taking notes much more diligently. Maybe even put your phone on airplane mode not to be interrupted. And it's the same content. And these are not the only benefits of e-learning platforms. Many have certificates of completion, detailed testing, ranking systems for students, and all these elements will motivate you to learn more effectively, boost your self-awareness, and actually acquire the skill you set your mind to master. Something that no textbook or YouTube video will ever be able to do. And since I mentioned YouTube, let's jump to the second scenario of skill acquisition. This time you want a specific solution not macro learning. While online courses are still valid, it can prove difficult to find a specific solution you want within an entire course. In fact, to match this growing need for quick and to-the-point information, the interest in micro learning with 5-10 minute courses has seen a significant growth in the past years. If we look at Google Trends, it grew 10 times in just 3 years. But until it matures, the immediate solution to learning something as you need it remains forums and industry-specific communities. So what you need here in order to speed things up are great search abilities. So make sure you know some advanced search techniques like the usage of quotes, inside search, how to exclude specific keywords. And before we move on to our next component of the SUN, staying up-to-date system, I encourage you to do this quick action item. So now you're one acquiring a new skill. Schedule a few hours each week for learning. If you've read Stephen Covey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, you might know about the 4 quadrants with quadrant 2 being important and not urgent things. Allocating time here will increase your circle of influence and minimize quadrant 1, which is mainly comprised of emergencies. By doing so, you'll see measurable authentic growth in your career and knowledge. Use whatever tool you want, Google Calendar, your favorite to-do app, and schedule those hours. Commit. This is the most important part. Treat it as client work or as a job assignment, not as something optional. And then we have scenario number two, learning as you need it. The beauty of this is that you can always ask a more experienced colleague; however, make sure to follow the 15 minutes rule. Struggle finding a solution yourself for 15 minutes then ask for help. Otherwise, you might become disruptive for your colleague's productivity. So the action item here has two parts, first, identify the platforms where you usually find the easily understandable answers. I remember when I was creating websites in college, I always found solutions to HTML CSS problems on Stack Overflow. More recent, whenever I'm looking for new productivity tools to test and to use, I go to Quora. So search for the relevant community for your industry, which I bet you already know. Then look into refining your search skills because knowing how to formulate good queries is what makes the difference if you find a solution in one minute or if you have to go through tens of pages that don't answer your exact question. That being said, we'll move on to the next section, updates.

Updates
Updates. As I said, this is the news element of the system. The main problem with news is that it's not real education and can easily become a procrastination vacuum instead of a productivity booster. The idea is that we already watch the news, read blogs, and get information on many topics that don't interest us or where we have 0 impact. So why not filter everything to stay relevant to our career interests? The ideal time to integrate this component into your staying-ahead strategy is during dead time. You can place in this category everything from your commute, while in the bathroom, while doing chores, or waiting in line somewhere. Now obviously the content you consume depends on your activity, so during your commute, a podcast might be more appropriate than reading a blog post. Also, some forms of content might resonate with you more than others. But no matter where you get your updates from, as far as you fill your dead time with them you'll still be on track. So here's the action item for this component of the system. Step number one is set up Google Alerts for the topics that interest you. Make sure to make your alerts as specific as possible so you don't get bombarded with redundant data. There is a risk of information overload where you will simply start to ignore the updates you receive. I know I've been guilty of this a few times. Step number two is identify the influencers in your industry. This should take you just a few minutes and will prove immensely helpful in staying up-to-date with trends and changes and even open the door for career opportunities down the road. Step number three, follow those brands and influencers on the social media networks you use frequently and subscribe to their blogs and newsfeeds. A good resource I found for most tech categories is medium. com, which in my opinion is a blessing for blogging. And speaking of medium, don't hesitate to start writing your own insights and thoughts if you want to pursue becoming an authority in your industry. But the main problem with always being up-to-date is that it's important and yet it's not. Having a constant feed of new ideas, knowing all the changes in the industry will help you make almost future-proof decisions; however, you must never place them ahead in importance of actually doing and executing on your know-how. So make sure not to fall in the paralysis by analysis scenarios where you keep reading and learning yet never creating. This creeps up on the best of us. For now, we'll move on to the last element of your staying up-to-date system, networking.

Networking
Networking. And here we have both online and offline mediums. If we're talking online, this can be Facebook groups, forums, even the comment sections on popular blogs. If we're talking offline, these are meet-ups, conferences that can be in your own town, which you should attend at least once a month, or globally, which you should go to as often as possible. You might say, what's the deal with networking? What's the real value it gives? And as I said at the start of the module, you won't always get ground-breaking new information, especially if we're talking local events, but what you will get is connections and a new way of doing things. Connections can lead to new job and business opportunities, and why not friendships? And a new perspective might make your new project far more successful or allow you to avoid group think where you and your entire team are blind to a flaw in your strategy, but you're all on the same page and can't see it. And what I personally found to be extremely helpful about networking is that you'll occasionally find people that will simply inspire you and your drive and motivation will skyrocket as well. Or you'll meet people that have surprised some problems you are currently facing, and seeing that it's possible to overcome them will again give you more hope and courage towards achieving your goals. So what are the action points here? First, you need to treat this with great importance because otherwise it will just be a someday thing. Yeah, I wanted to go to that event, but got caught up with a project. The road to someday leads to a town of nowhere, as one wise man once said. So step number one, try attending at least one local event each month. Go to sites like meetup or eventbrite and search for something relevant to you. If there is nothing, consider organizing one yourself. If we're talking online, join relevant communities for your industry and try mingling at least 20 or 30 minutes each day, but every day. You'll be amazed how fast you get to become a top contributor in such communities. And I'm not talking theory here. I answer questions regarding e-learning on Quora for about 30 minutes a week. I even skip some weeks. And in just a few months, I got to be the most viewed writer for several topics and got over 300, 000 views, and all it took was answering about 150 questions. So never underestimate the compound effect a little effort over a long period of time can have. Action item number two, look for top events in your country or region. Pick one or two a year that you will attend. Consider all the expenses, save up, and when the time comes go for it. If you are still having trouble meeting people in your industry, try going occasionally to co-working spaces. Most of them usually organize both tech and networking events and they are a great way to meet new people and get different perspectives on your ideas, goals, and view of things in general. And that's all on the SUN staying up-to-date system. As you saw, it's not that complicated. You just set aside a few hours each week for learning that you stick to, you stay up-to-date on news during dead time, and attend events regularly. It's a process that compounds in value over time, but you have to keep doing it. You can't shortcut the system. I remember a great metaphor I once heard at comparing things to doing pushups. If you do a few push-ups every day, in less than 6 months you'll be able to do 50 plus. Even if when you start out you can do just five. However, if you skip the first four months, it's impossible to cram in the last two months all the work you missed out on. It's the same reason why traditional education is failing lots of students right now. Because it's an artificial system where the objective is no longer learning, but passing the exam, which, if you study for last minute you manage to pass and confuse a degree with expertise in the field. And as I stated in the principles module, the key to getting better is doing and executing based on the information you have. We'll wrap this up here and move on to the next module. We'll have a hands-on, step-by-step guide for the staying up-to-date system constructed on a few examples so it's easier to understand and adapt to your own needs. So I'm looking forward to see you in the next module.

Working Systems Samples
Your Resource Inventory
Examples of working systems. In this module, we're going to go over a few samples so you know exactly how a working system looks like. This is not to be considered a finished model, but a perpetual beta that you periodically revise and improve. Also share the model components along the way so you can adapt it to your own specific needs with ease. For this example, let's presume I'm a front-end developer and want to stay up-to-date on things. As we discussed in the previous module, one of the core components is identifying the three areas: skill acquisition, updates, and networking. And in doing so, you'll be creating an inventory of resources. And this inventory has communities: networks, forums, websites highly relevant to your industry where you can get an answer fast and interact with other people in the business. Second, blogs: places that offer constant updates, advice, best practices that will help you stay relevant and increase your output. Third spot, influencers. Who are the people you should follow on various networks, be it Facebook, Twitter, Dribbble, Stack Overflow, or whatever. They can give you insight, answer burning questions, and be a gateway to a plethora of opportunities. And forth, podcasts. Same as with blogs, they are a similar resource in a different format. This can consume very unproductive moments like when you wait in line somewhere, when you do chores, or are idle for whatever reason. And fifth, meet-ups. That will allow you to create connections, find opportunities, and make friends. And the way you start building this resource inventory is by searching. That's why I said it's essential to be good at this particular skill because it will have a huge impact on how long it will take for you to compile the previously mentioned list and also on the quality of the items on that list. So for example, we start with a search on how to keep up-to-date as a front-end developer. Depending on your industry, you might get lucky and find a search result where someone has already done all the hard work for you. And you get an almost complete list, like I got here. However, even if you do get lucky, don't get lazy. Menu items on lists like these can be obsolete or no longer relevant. So after doing a few macro searches on the industry, you should start being more specific for each category. For example, you can search for top 10 front-end developers to follow and check out each of their profiles, look at their recent updates, and decide for yourself who is relevant to you, both content and attitude wise, and add them to your people-to-follow list. As far as where to save your resource inventory, you have multiple options. Either make it public on your website as a resource page for everyone to use and share it, an action that will help you grow your audience and following, or save it somewhere private like a Slack Channel, Trello Board, Evernote, whatever you feel more comfortable with. After completing your resource inventory, what I encourage you to do is go to Google Alerts and add some keywords and key phrases that are very specific to your interests. For example, let's say you are located in Boston. Those alerts could be front-end meetups in Boston, tech events in Boston. Choose to receive these updates daily or weekly and read them during your dead time like when waiting in line somewhere or when you're on a break. If the results are too generic, make your alerts more specific. Same, if you rarely get any notifications, go broader. As I said, it's a perpetual beta model. Then comes step number three of the SUN stay up-to-date system where you set reminders for two very important components that otherwise will get overlooked or set aside for someday. You absolutely need to make time for learning new things. Be it watching a course on Pluralsight, YouTube video on a specific problem you're interested in, or reading a chapter from a book you just bought. And it's not relevant what you use to remind yourself, as long as it gets results. It can be Google Calendar, any reminder app on your phone, or even your wife, girlfriend, husband, or mother. The next step, although simple, might take some time to make a habit. First, compile a list of all your dead time and decide what to do with it. Instead of playing Angry Birds while on the toilet, see what your influencers have been tweeting. Instead of reading labels or listening to other people's conversations while in line at the super market, read those blogs. Instead of reading magazines while waiting at the dentist, listen to that latest podcast episode. You decide what type of content you consume and when, but make sure to fill as much as possible of that dead time as you can. Then comes the last step of the system, execution. Look, I strongly believe in the practicality and usefulness of everything I mention in this course, but if you neglect this step you miss out on most of the value it brings to your professional life. All the resources are catalysts, so without work, the practice of the skill, they don't have anything to amplify. So once again, make sure to put in the hours to code, design, manage, whatever your profession requires. Coming up next, we'll look at the end result of the SUN staying up-to-date system applied for the front-end developer example and also one more scenario. Then we'll have a quick course overview and you can be on your way to accelerate your career and skillset. I'm looking forward to see you there.

Working Systems Examples
So here we are. As you can see, I chose the path of making this public. You might decide to keep it private, either just for yourself or for your team. You can see the influencers I consider relevant. Yours might be totally different depending on your style and needs, and that's perfectly okay. Then, I have listed the blogs I should regularly check, newsfeeds, podcasts. Although this is mostly a resource for other people since I subscribe to them on my phone and that's where I go and listen to them. Then, you have all the relevant events and meetups, which again have reminders on my phone so I know when I need to get ready to attend them. And speaking of phones and reminders, I use CheckMark too because it has geo-triggered notifications and they're set to ring whenever I am at the supermarket or at the doctor because those are the places where I'm usually idle for more than 5 minutes. I've also created the habit of listening to podcasts whenever I drive so I have that solved as well. You can use any app you want. Just make sure it has this geo-triggered feature that comes in very handy for this system. Besides this, each day at 10:00 PM I have a reminder to read up or watch a video training for at least 30 minutes. I'll admit, sometimes I skip it, but if I follow the schedule just three days a week I am still making good progress. The other industry I've chosen to make an example for is design, which although is completely different in resources, still has the same structure as the developer resource inventory with influencers, blogs, newsfeeds, podcasts, events, and meetups. What I encourage you to do is to create your very own specific resource inventory and share it in the discussion section of the course to help people in the same industry as you. Maybe even connect with each other since you have shared interest and grow together as professionals in your field. You can also share your recommendations if you think I should add a particular resource on the pages I created myself. In fact, I highly encourage it. And that's about it. We'll move on to the next and final module, course overview. And there, we'll briefly go over everything we've covered in the course, and you're all set. I'm looking forward to see you in the next and final module.

Course Summary
Course Overview
Course overview. First of all, I'd like to congratulate you for reaching the end of the course because as I said at some point so few do because they are not consistent with their learning and with staying up-to-date. We'll quickly go over everything we covered in the course then you can be on your way to do what you love. We first started with the reason you want to stay up-to-date be it professional growth, relevance, significance, we all have one. The better you define and understand your reason, the stronger your drive and motivation will be. We then jump directly to the five core concepts: move your feet, which stresses on the importance of doing, not just learning and knowing things, solving a problem, which is the root of all progress, the fact that there is no speed limit and that you are the only one holding yourself back, getting yourself a mentor if possible or at least becoming part of a group of like-minded individuals, and last but not least, teaching others what you've learned. Next up was the science of learning where again we took things from principles up. Here you discovered the importance of looking at learning as play and the importance of good habits. Then we analyzed the factors that influence learning, both internal and external ones. With heredity and the environment playing a big role, but also how important it is to have clear goals, stay motivated, pay attention and practice, avoid fatigue, have guidance, and positive emotions towards learning as concept and the subject you want to get better at. Since I didn't want this module to be all theory, we looked at the best practices with evidence based education and all its techniques from using analogies, making notes, having a growth mindset, repetition and practice, cooperation, goal setting, and hypothesis testing. We then talked about cognitive acceleration, a very effective group learning technique that you can apply on top of your existing project briefs where you set the scene and make an inventory of your resources, identify the challenge, brainstorm, have a plenary where you analyze metacognition, so you not only know the solution, but also the train of thought that led you to that solution, and then bridge the new information to existing know-how to maximize its impact. We then went to sleep and how essential it is for learning and memory and that you should always have sufficient quantity and quality of it. And last but not least, we talked about the rapid acquisition method that will allow you to learn almost anything in 20 hours. You just get your tools ready, you then deconstruct the skill, learn enough to self-correct, reduce practice barriers, and put in 20 hours of deliberate, focused practice. We then moved on to the core modules of this course, the ones where you actually learned to set up your systems and stay relevant and up-to-date. We talked a bit about looking at this as a perpetual beta model where you keep improving and perfecting over time and you're never fully done. You discovered the SUN staying up-to-date system with its three components: skill acquisition, updates, and networking. You learned how to create your own resource inventory with communities, blogs, influencers, podcasts, and meet-ups. You integrated and scheduled learning time in your calendar that I hope you will stick to. And also you've identified your dead time where you can get up-to-date with things from blogs, podcasts, and newsfeeds. And throughout the entire course, I kept repeating over and over and over and over again the importance of doing. And this is valid to any aspect of life. Even the creation of this course. Although the resource part took maybe 10 times more than writing and recording it, if I had stopped at knowing and not proceeded with doing you wouldn't have been listening to it right now. That being said, I thank you for your attention, your commitment to see this course to the end, and I am eager to hear your thoughts, the insights you got from the course, and even your criticism. Also, don't forget to share your resource inventory if you created one in the discussion section if you want to make it public. My name is Doru Catana, and it's been a real pleasure creating this course for you on Pluralsight.
